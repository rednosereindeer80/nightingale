Right now, I'm freelancing and also driver to Grab/GoCar. 

I also kinda know my way around Jakarta, you know? Cool hangout spots, good eats, chill places, hidden gems, etc.

So yeah, I could totally be your Jakarta tour guide, especially if you're curious about riding public transport and hitting up those roadside ""warteg"" spots where you can eat for less than 15K. 'Cause I'm always hopping on public transport, I know the KRL, Busway, and MRT routes like the back of my hand.

Need a ride to the airport or a pickup from the airport? I can help you out with that too. Your personal chauffeur, right here! Or if you wanna explore Jakarta for the whole day, I'm down. Can even help lug your stuff around. 

Why roll with me instead of just using a ride-hailing app? Well, with me, you're guaranteed to get picked up on time. Clean car (it's a Toyota Rush, not a fancy ride but it's my personal car). No hassle, and you won't end up with some weirdo driver who'll just piss you off. You know how it is if you read the news – lots of strange online drivers out there, all sorts of cases and stuff. It's 'cause the app takes a huge cut, stresses the drivers out, and makes it hard for them to make a living.

Plus, I can speak English, so I can be your chat buddy too!

Just hit me up if you're keen or wanna ask anything first.","","🩷 (14)"

This is the story of Ketravelan. 3 years ago, we had a vision. We launched Jommoutdoor with passion, and learned incredible lessons.

Jommoutdoor had taught us so much about genuine connections and the power of stepping outside your comfort zone.

What we're building at Ketravelan isn't just another travel platform, it's bigger than we ever imagined.
It's for everyone who's ever felt stuck, who's ever needed to pivot, who dares to do things differently.

Our official launch is on 27 August 2025!

Follow us on IG to learn more and get updates! Appreciate the support. 🫶🏻

Piko is 4 months young, 4 kg, a mix of Kampung & Shih Tzu/Pomeranian (said the vet), easily trained (Piko could already do a handshake), and Piko is getting a full set of vaccine on Friday 21st of November, so he could be taken by Sunday!! ☺️💗

Please chat me if anyone is interested in adopting Piko so I could send more details there, thank you!! 🥰
