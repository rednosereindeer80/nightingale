While the main purpose is to avoid discomfort i usually end up even more restless, and when you're restless you use the same technique to numb your feelings down and it becomes a habit thats hard to let go of, doing anything that doesnt require your phone like washing your face, meditating, journalling feels like a chore. Then When you want to Reach out to someone about your issues, theres a layer of hesitation, ""i might bother them"" ""maybe they're busy"" ""they're probably going through harder things"" and your phone doesn't have that, it's an object to use at your whims and it has many ways of keeping your attention in. Further making me feel Isolated and addicted at the same time.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1389942981800497172/1389953844900794378/Screenshot_20250702_195800_Digital_Wellbeing.jpg?ex=699660a4&is=69950f24&hm=bfb0012cc5d0e889f517c0b4a993f206e2b4eaf9c43f4955b637051a5ed18af6&",""
