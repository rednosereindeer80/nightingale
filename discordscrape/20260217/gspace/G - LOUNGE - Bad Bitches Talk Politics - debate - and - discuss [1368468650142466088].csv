"" I actually support Dedi Mulyadi's proposal, I think the poor need to be incentivized to stop having children, and that until they are able to reach a level of  financial security, a government-subsidized reversible vasectomy done by qualified surgeons, and obviously paired with open-communication, education, transparency of conditions + consent to T&C is the most effective way to go."" — *further elaboration needed but this is the gist*","",""

Totally with Dedi Mulyadi on this one – people who are poor and need ""Bansos"" should get vasectomies. But making that a reality in Indonesia? Fuggedaboutit. Too many folks still think ""more kids, more blessings,"" and that kids are super important, believing their fortune's all in God's hands. It's a freakin' uphill battle trying to educate people like that, 'cause let's face it, there are way more people with low education than those who are educated, and usually, the less educated are just plain stubborn! So changing their mindset is a nightmare, and they're easy to rile up. We're a democracy, so these less educated folks have a massive voting bloc, which is why some people want to keep them that way so they can be controlled. The less educated people are, the easier they are to steer with hoaxes and propaganda.

There's also the argument that poor people have more kids while rich people don't. It's 'cause the poor don't know other pleasures; all they know is freakin' intercourse as their only source of fun. They've got tons of free time 'cause they're bored, so they just do the sex. Get bored easily, do the sex again. Plus, they're not educated about protection and all that. Rich people, on the other hand, have a ton of other fun stuff to do besides sex – traveling, sports, other entertainment. Plus, rich people are usually busy and already tired. Poor people often have no job, nothing to do, so they've got a lot of free time. No money for anything else, so the free fun is sex. 😅😅😅

But it's become this super complicated mess. The new challenge is how to educate them, give them things to do, and explain that pleasure isn't just about sex. There's a whole world out there!
Lots of kids, poor kids not going to school, creates this structural poverty that's already a huge headache.","","💯 (2)"

These people, no matter how much you try to educate them, no matter what factual, science-based information you give them, unfortunately they don't want to take them. They don't want to listen. @Miguel is right, they're stubborn. Why? Lots of reasons, but one prominent one is typically due to how taboo & controversial contraception & family planning are considered here still, as a result of incorrect religious dogmas & teachings.","",""

They can reverse the vasectomies and have biological kids, or tbh adopt, if/when they climb out of poverty.","",""

I just wanted to jump in and share something personal I’ve been reflecting on….As a foreigner living in Jogja, I’ve genuinely felt welcomed by a lots of ppl  here  everyone’s been more than friendly in many ways, and I appreciate that deeply. But at the same time, I’ve noticed something a bit more complicated. … There are certain places or situations where I feel… objectified, I guess? Like I become the center of attention just because of how I look. I get stared at not always in a rude way, but in that “whoa, I’ve never seen a Black person before” kind of way. And while I get that it’s probably coming from curiosity more than hate, it still makes me feel uncomfortable. Not threatened, not angry  just not at ease….. It’s weird because I’m actually a social person by nature  I like going out, meeting people, connecting. But this feeling sometimes makes me pull back, stay home, and get a little introverted, even though that’s not really me. There’s a bit of fear in the back of my mind  like, will I be stared at again? Will I feel out of place again?","","🩷 (1)"

And yes, pretty much during my teenage years when I've met foreigners, I did stared at them (which my parents told me multiple times to not do so since it can be considered ""impolite"" or ""rude"" in their opinions) out of seeing these people being taller than most Indonesians I saw in my daily life, so my 12 years old got pretty curious to see them. Then once I grew up and went to Australia for vacation one day, I did got the similar stare I've did to other foreigners, but this time from some children who saw me. For me, I simply shrugged it off when I saw these people mainly being children (you can't be mad at them if their intention are genuinely curious) yet I matured enough to understand on why people are feeling discomfort when being stared at (especially for more than 10 seconds). But yeah, I do advised some of my students to not stare people for too long out of avoiding misunderstanding and possible discomfort they can create for other people.","","❤️ (1)"

The concerns about it being a ""rabbit experiment"" are reasonable considering the reputation of medical institutions in Indonesia aren't at its best rn. What people forgot about Gates' action was the fact that this isn't the first time he did such a thing. Since 2009, Gates Foundation had gave more than 300 million US dollars to health sectors in Indonesia along with some other sectors. It makes sense for Gates to invest some testing in Indonesia for that case considering the huge sum of money being invested to begin with. After further reading and trying to find other links, it seems not only Gates Foundation joined this effort, but a collaborate project with Universitas Indonesia, Universitas Padjadjaran, and Bio Farma. Hopefully a proper clear communication and transparency in the project can be addressed soon enough since we already see how a few of us questioned the methods and process from this deal itself. I would also gave my thoughts that the country should keep the project well balanced, lest we need another situation in the long run where the collaborative project had turned into dependency on other multinational company. Indonesia has a chance to seize it to enhance its domestic capacity with this deal, not the other way around. I will see if this project turned out in the long run along with who's holding the important positions for such projects.","",""

But my argument isn’t limited to Christianity. It extends to any religion that claims God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving—which includes Islam and Judaism, too. If you’re coming from the Qur’an or the Torah and want to offer other verses or frameworks, I’m open to that. But the core problem I’m addressing applies to the God of all Abrahamic religions.","",""
"521606139985788928","audryssa","2025-05-14T03:53:14.7830000+00:00","I don’t believe that an all-loving, all-powerful, all-knowing God exists—because if that God did exist, then the world as we see it makes no moral sense.

The most obvious issue is suffering—not just human suffering, but suffering that has absolutely no moral explanation. Not the result of choice, or sin, or consequence.

A fawn burns alive in a forest fire. A whale starves slowly because of plastic tangled in its mouth. A tree branch falls on a deer’s spine and leaves it paralyzed until it dies of thirst. There’s no lesson in that. No soul being tested. No “free will” to protect. It’s just pain.

And yet we’re told God is all-powerful—He could stop it. All-knowing—He knew it would happen. And all-loving—He’s supposed to care.

People say, “Well, that’s just nature.” But if God created nature, and chose to create it with these mechanics—this brutal indifference—then you can’t just absolve Him by calling it natural. He made the system.

The usual fallback is free will. That humans choose evil, and God allows it out of love. But I don’t think free will explains anything here. First, because we’re not truly free. I didn’t choose to like fried chicken. I didn’t choose my temperament, my triggers, my compulsions, or the conditions I was raised in. And if we don’t even fully choose ourselves, how can we be fully blamed for what we become?

But even if we did have true free will—it doesn’t explain why the universe had to include tsunamis, pediatric cancer, or parasitic worms that eat children’s eyes. That’s not human choice. That’s design.

And if God knew all of this would happen—and scripture says He did:

“All the days ordained for me were written in your book…” (Psalm 139:16)
Then He created this world with full awareness of every horror it would contain.

So either He couldn’t create a better one—which makes Him not all-powerful.

Im gonna try to insert my opinion through the Christian lens.

At the end of the day when people ask ""why do bad things happen"" most of the time the answer is either ""because free will"" or because ""if no bad then no good as well"" and tbh logically speaking if God is indeed all powerful then He could have created a world that transcends both of these arguments.

However I think thats why faith is such a beautiful thing. The only reason its called ""faith"" is because we CHOOSE to believe. So at this point in my life now, I choose that God got me. 

I've been through some problems where I only overcame them by praying. It can be argued further that maybe it was just dumb luck and a coincidence. However ever since I have chosen to firmly believe and just chill w it, my life has definitely gotten better. (again, in my opinion at least. it might be a case of bias or coincidental events that I might have blinded myself into.)","",""

I’m not here to invalidate personal faith, and I understand that for many people, belief is something that brings peace, not logical resolution. I respect that.

That said, I do think your answer quietly sidesteps the actual problem I’m raising.

I’m not asking why you choose to believe, or whether faith has helped you feel better about life. I’m asking whether it makes logical sense to describe God as all-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful—when we live in a world filled with suffering that is both non-moral and non-human.

For ministry of women and child protection, APBN 2025 only gave them 300 million rupiah more or less, and it is very small compared to trillions being poured for other ministries, we can start with better resource allocation. Then police training for these cases should be done considering so far, their training really didn't emphasize specific cases such as these ones. Thus when they meet one irl, they themselves were confused on how to do it (other than being corrupt). Third, ministry of education should have collaborated with ministry of women and child protection. Education does not only cover schools, but society as a whole in which they should collaborated with other related ministries in this one (but we know how complex the bureaucracy process to begin with). Fourth, media exposure and even more viral videos or podcasts being made about awareness on child protection and sexual assault. Viralism is basically the more effective tool here in which such cases like this one can be used as a momentum for influencers, especially women influencers to voiced out against the issues, bringing awareness for society, at least for younger generations.","","💯 (2)"

However, the way we response is somehow different. millenials have that sparks as hero or the It girl vibe. as for gen z, you guys react a bit delicate and i believe it's very human instead of us millenial who assume we have that thick skin.

-Old Millennials are more skeptical and reserved, had analog and digital. Had the same Gen X grit.
-Core Millennials grew up from the social media and the rise of the digital landscape. They're expressive, cringe, and too social, but they're depressed due to the crash in the job market. This is the generation that introduced expensive burgershops and barbers. Politics are very Obama.
-Young Millennials also grew up during the rise of digital landscape but are exposed to meme culture, Instagram and Twitter. Massively liberal, introverted, and chic. This is the Tumblr, Pinterest millennials. Very alternative and indie.
2. Gen Z
-Zillenials or Old Gen Zs. Almost indistinguishable from Young Millennials. Exposed to too much Instagram, Vine and meme culture. Prone to right or left libertarianism than liberalism. Vocal, critical and postmodern.
-Peak Gen Zs. Experienced their childhood to teen during the rise of algorithms from 2018 to 2023. Tiktok, Roblox and Fortnite oriented, Short attention span, very exposed to gaming, anime, pop culture niche media. Cynical, jaded but entrepreneurial.

And some are being really nasty, putting fake orders at hospitals or malls, asking for pickups at the lobby, So the driver goes into the lobby, pays for parking, and then it gets canceled. The driver loses money.

The demo is actually hurting other drivers. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

But stuff like this will always be a pro and con thing, I guess. On one hand, if there are still drivers working, the demo won't have a big impact either.","","😭 (1)"

1. Indonesia was on the receiving end of Imperialism and so did South Korea. Historically, Indonesian independence was granted after Indonesia struggled against the Dutch, the British and Australians, while South Korean independence was secured by the United States after a period of fighting against Soviet Union, China and North Korea. So Indonesia was an outlier while South Korea was already a US ally.
2. South Korea is a small, homogenous society concentrated at one half of a peninsula. Indonesia is a humongous archipelago and has a divisive and heterogenic society. South Korea is able to make policies based on a single ethnicity and easily distribute goods due to proximity, Indonesia while Javacentric, has to make policies for more ethnicities and distribution of goods is hard cause distance.
3. South Korea received generous donations from the US and the West from the start, and due to their security guaranteed by the states, South Korea does not have to think that much about defense (though they spend more than Japan due to their closeness to North Korea). Money that can be spent on defense is spent on other things.
4. Park Chung Hee and Soeharto are almost similar in terms of nation building. Park Chung Hee and Soeharto kept pet oligarchs (chaebols and sembilan naga). While Park Chung Hee didn't have to think about opposition, he was free to develop bureaucracy and better systems, while Soeharto needed to maintain loyalty of the vast amount of interest after killing 3 million Indonesians. That's why Park encouraged business while Soeharto has business dependent on state access.
5. South Korea is always on the brink of existentialist destruction, Indonesia isn't.","","🔥 (1)"

My simple but complex question is: Why don’t Indonesians have the same mentality? Maybe outside of people in Jakarta or Surabaya, I can’t seem to draw a parallel to how Indonesians work.

but i saw that the landscape of work & labor never changes. 

yes the education is one major problem, but the main main main problem is. we are lazy af. 

i cannot tell you how many times i give free classes, free mentorship, even to the underbelly of desa or kabupaten but somehow we are as a whole is so lazy. 

i have been preaching even till this day about how we can use the same 24 hour to make ourself useful and they aint listen. 

this create an extra burden for those who is extremely diligent. we work double because our lazy ass matte wont solve a thing. endless debate about undervalue is not just because we are paid less, but the job distribution and value is a mess because (unfortunately) the boss are too lazy to analyze the core problem. 

as i said i work remotely now, people are shock how fast and efficient I am as INDONESIAN. damn that's hurt. but sadly that's what happen. 

that's why people who is dilligent and has the gut to lead can actually win the game and separate from the rest. for many years i am oran dalem secret weapon to make sure all the work is smooth and done. its so hard to make people get the job done.","","‼️ (1)"

i mean really so many characteristics are taken for granted and attributed to generations or honestly any kind of identity without interrogating what those characteristics are and how they actually manifest in reality and why they came to be
in reality leadership styles and skilled labour mobilisation have always loop around the same handful of ""perspectives""

at the end of the day, training and education and skill and whatever your 'talent' has in their resume cannot be considered to be plug and play into your team/workplace/organisation
i dont care what kind of hot seat ""leader"" you think you are but whatever innovations you expect your fellow humans to come up with to adapt to changes have to be formalised and broadcasted
if you want to ""tetap komunikasi"" you have to be a willing node for information
beyond micromanagement and mere relaying orders, this is how you lose institutional memory and irrecoverably brain drain
when, as a leader, you dont do your principal responsibility, which is taking the initiative to lead and get your 'trigger pullers' involved in planning
so they know how to do their jobs regardless of any ""culture"" of asking when confused and outlining expectations

- 20 years personal vehicle ownership ban
- lifetime political afiliation ban that spans the current generation (meaning all living relative, and direct children)","","❤️ (2)"

Cmiiw, to my knowledge, this also applies to civilians, not just governmental personnel.

Big fear is because the government is the judge, jury and executioner. As such they can make up shit to get people incarcerated just to take over their personal assets to disperse between themselves. And it is open to politicization, you can witch hunt your political opponents and such.

We've seen people who should be jailed run scot free (e.g. Fadli Zon), and people who shouldn't be jailed, actually jailed (e.g. Tom Lembong)","","💪 (1)"

The government *means* well to provide these school lunches but it was executed very poorly. As Indonesia is the land of the corrupt, it's easy to assume whatever money that was spent providing to these programs, not all of it is actually going to that program. If we look into Tangsel's budget and compare to that number, probably around 50-60% of the budget actually goes to the program who is providing these meals. Now whether or not the meals are ""bergizi"", when you take the budget of about 10k per person per meal, halve it, and that is the budget for 1 meal. Now that is feasable in some rural areas, but not more urban areas, bear in mind when I say feasable in rural areas I am thinking nasi tempe tahu. When you start to standardize their meals tho that's where things got fucky wucky. Supply chain issues, children not liking the food issue will happen, not to mention costs will hike as well, let alone their ""nutritious"" label.

This project does not look like a Rp. 13 Trillion project, and if we're taking the 50-60% figure, well This doesn't even look like a Rp. 6 Trillion project as well.","","💯 (1)"

Maybe 1 kitchen per province for trials, situated randomly in either a rural or an urban area, so there are 30-odd kitchens total, not thousands like it is now. Have like a 3-6 months of working kitchen, providing food to the kids, fixing the kinks in the system. Then slowly, expand out the kitchens, a successful kitchen will train staffs and managers of a future kitchen-to-be, then when they have that new kitchen it should hit the ground running. This will then multiply, when a kitchen is all set and steady, it will keep on producing and teaching new staff, so when the new kitchen emerges it should just go without any problems.","","💯 (1)"

1. They barely look edible

3. The cheese doesn't even taste like food, more like salty plastic
4. Too many students from all around the city found caterpillars in their burgers
5. A lot of parents prefer to pack their kids lunches especially after all the reports, so more often than not those MBG end up untouched and go to waste

Most classic foodborne intoxications take mere hours to 5 days to show symptoms, such as e.coli which could take 3-5 days, or  s.aureus which could take hours.

When we see videos like this rise, it's VERY POSSIBLE that unorthodox foodborne diseases could happen (I say unorthodox because holy shit that's just so gross, it doesn't often happen in most well-regulated kitchens), and my best guess is

Botulinum toxin, a spore that could take days to incubate and cause nausea, vomiting, neurological issues. Listeria monocytogenes is also a possibility, but that's often found in milk that's not adequately pasteurised","","💯 (1)"

There's procurement of products of which you'll have to survey the best raw ingredients around, then there's accepting the deliveries of the products to make sure they're all up to spec, then there's storage, inventory system, preparation, AND on top of that watching over each critical points to make sure nothing bad happens, like food poisoning. 

I don't imagine DPR members willing to be that busy, they'd want quick and easy money. So how on Earth could FnB be easy money? Simple. Mark up the ingredients and tools, cut costs where costs shouldn't be cut at all, falsely report cash flow while getting getting money from the central government, because they have so much money to spend on and they're not watching","","👍 (2)"

**TW: S*icide and Bullying#**


**DISCLAIMER: I'm NOT defending Udayana University, but i want to highlight a few things that i thought i need to talk about.**

First of all, i want to express my condolences to Timothy's parents about what happened on 15th of October 2025. 

For context: Wednesday, 15th October 2025, Timothy jumped from the 4th floor of FISIP Building of Universitas Udayana in Denpasar, Bali and succumbed to his injuries. Soon after, some awful chat logs regarding news spread across social media. **i want to emphasize that this happened AFTER the incident, not before.** From what i gather, none of the perps actually know Timothy personally.

**My thoughts**
I think this incident highlights the problem that Indonesian education system, especially udayana has. Currently, there are no concrete evidences that confirms Timo being bullied by his peers. I believe this, because if that's the case, i'd assume atleast one person will speak out or atleast leak chats abt this. Also there's a video of Timo presenting some stuff, and his friends appears to laugh/cheering him, and i dont think they intend to laugh at him.

Without any intent of disrespecting Timo's family, i'm speculating that Timo has a condition, or a neurodivergent kid. I don't think being a neurodivergent is an issue, but the problem is, often it goes undiagnosed. I think this is why Timo felt isolated and lonely during his uni life, and possibly a key factor to his final decision. I'm gonna be honest, i don't Udayana is capable of providing the best environment for Timo. 

I have seen clips of Timo passion of speaking out about politics and he is really good about it. I think, political anxiety is also a factor on the incident.

Again, regarding the bullying allegation, I don't think Timo was bullied. But, i believe bullying still a real issue in Udayana.","","🩷 (3)"
"867421149126197300","chel705","2025-10-22T08:19:37.3940000+00:00","From what i've heard, bullying happened or still happening in fakultas teknik (dont quote me on that). And recently, someone got intimidated by a member of BEM Fakultas Kelautan dan Perikanan bcs of their posts abt the incident. One thing that i noticed is 

_""dah pintar kau? apa emg gapernah ngebully dan ga ke ekspos aja?""_

This, atleast for me, is a clear indication of systemized bullying culture that still happening in Udayana.

And for my faculty (Fakultas Kedokteran). I have never experience bullying during ospek or daily study. I think the reform of ospek after 2019/2021 (i forgot) plays a key role on reducing/decimating the bullying culture. Also the bullies that comes from FK are from angkatan 2021, are doing their co assistant (koas) at a hospital and possibly being bullied by their seniors there (not a fact, but i'd assume this still a thing bcs i heard hospital bullying is still rampant). 

So my point is, this is a systemic problem. Blaming 11 or 12 kids wont solve the issue. To prevent another death, Udayana or Government must seriously investigate the bullying culture that happened in every faculty. It's complicated, but necessary to prevent another tragedy like this.

Also Udayana very bad at issuing statements. At least give a clear info to the parents dude, wtf.

Just want to clear my mind abt this. Again, i don't condone bullying, but i don't think it's the main driving factor in this tragedy.

I know that in most countries or at certain universities, attendance rules are strict (esp since in some it's a requirement to pass). Recently, my Italian friend told me that in Italy, attendance doesn't matter. You can skip lectures entirely if you wany to and just show up for the exam. And even better, if you're not happy with your grade, you can retake the exam as many times as you want. The only catch is that most exams are oral, but honestly that system sounds kind of tempting.

I know that there might be an issue with people just not showing up, buuut personally, I've always struggled with attendance (and got judged, which is fair, and then again they didn't know what I was going through.) It possibly might be my mental health at that time and also because of fam matters. Never really checked it out further, my peers & even my mom had a suspicion that I might be in the spectrum, but I was only diagnosed with anxiety back in middle school. 

But still! I think a lot of people could benefit from a system like that, or maybe an accomodation for those who need it, dunno.

Honestly, I'm feeling that way and don't know what to do. I'm so lonely that I often get trapped in toxic relationships with temperamental, unfaithful, and manipulative men.

Absolutely, if we can. IMHO we have two political positions in this country: System and Anti-System. Trump was elected on an Anti-System push because Democrats spent the last 4 years doing nothing that really helped regular people and tried to run only ""the fear of Trump"" that got them in power in 2020. 
Now that we are reminded of how much we want a Government that doesn't deploy the military into our cities and more importantly for most Americans that actually gives the economic goodies we'll try to elect Democrats again even if their only promise is not to be worse.

However, the way we do Democracy is also being changed substantially. It is very possible that by 2026, no matter how much we want neo-libral-conservatives, our votes wont count enough anymore.","",""

Unfortunately, in Indonesia, people tend to lump everything together. One person does something wrong, and suddenly the whole group gets blamed. If we used that logic, then straight people should be banned too — since most harassment cases come from them anyway","","‼️ (2)"

Korea) as an example and from what I hear people are struggling there in ways that sound similar to the struggles I feel as an American. Indonesia, in my limited Bule experience has felt different but as a ""cowboy"" I've never thought to look at it through a collectivist lens, just an economic one. 

From an economic perspective I see a lot more opportunities for people in Indonesia. It seems more like what I read the US was like in the 60s. Give and take, right? People back then and in Indonesia now have a better chance of owning a home then I do here, but it was built with asbestos, lead paint, with the wall stuffed with newspapers. 

Around here for my life it has felt like a lobster pot (slowly getting hotter so the lobster doesn't know it is boiling.) That's how I relate to your ""darkness"" and ""aimlessness.""

I’ve been thinking for a while about starting my own political party, but due to limited funding, I came up with a more practical shortcut: creating an online political party for Indonesia — Partai Online Indonesia.

The key idea is to recruit seven influencers in each electoral district. For example, if a district has 7,000 voters, each influencer would aim to bring in around 1,000 supporters.

In the ideal scenario — if everything goes well — we could potentially secure the entire district and win all seven representative seats.","","🤔 (1)"

1. By legal standards, the party must follow a set of requirements to be a proper legal party:
-The party must be established by at least 50 Indonesian citizens through a notarial deed. You need more than just 7 influencers but this mean the 7 influencers are the main members instead of other members yes?
-The party must have articles of association and standing orders, along with an executive board at the national level which needed to be set up. You might need an expert to do so but I believe these influencers should have at least known one or two people. 
-As a party, you must at least have executive board present in at least 50% of the provinces, 50% of the regencies/cities within those very same provinces, and 25% of the districts in those regencies/cities. Now yes, you can operate the activities online but still need to establish the boards along with building to operate it. This means logistical and operational costs will be included.
2. Reliance on influencers are not enough to win the voters as there may be a lot of voters already loyal to the established parties so better do surveys or mapping on the political situation for the specific areas.
3. You still need to convert virtual supports for the actual voting, so it may need more than just online presence. Remember, rural populace which are still the majority relies not on the online promotions, but bansos and connections with their own local figures. I can see this party to become a party that will attract urban populace tho for most of the viewers.","","👍 (1)"

first of all,** let’s all not pretend that this isn’t just another project for certain government officials and certain other non-government entities to make more money for themselves at the literal expense and inconvenience of small businesses. **

to financially burden UMKMs that they HAVE to get a halal certification, unless they want to be consistently sent a warning letter and eventually face getting our businesses shut down, is not only incredibly inefficient and unnecessary bureaucracy, but it is also especially inhumane to do, in the backdrop of a struggling economy where most UMKMs are already barely making enough money to keep up with costs. 

also literally does nobody else here think that making products and services that do not align with Islamic values as “illegal” — flat out discriminatory and stigmatizing? 

***i don't think*** this  applies to products that are **obviously haram** like alcohol and cigarettes, but it applies to everything else.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1368468650142466088/1440933995079794778/C964F3BF-26A7-49BC-AF43-C11DA9876CF7_1_105_c.jpeg?ex=69969cdb&is=69954b5b&hm=e7f547d45e39ec8a514917eb241c93573ab804556fced5f10cb5b60eb4d10e21&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1368468650142466088/1440933995423600640/IMG_5988.png?ex=69969cdb&is=69954b5b&hm=e4b6cc60ba8672fd2934b607a591953cebc527ca6b96bbe8cb301257a5fa8729&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1368468650142466088/1440933995746693210/Screenshot_2025-11-20_at_12.13.57.png?ex=69969cdb&is=69954b5b&hm=4ac2bfcfdf40f3475e58406eb3a34dfbf928428b978813e50b34cfc2e711d75f&","👍 (5)"

Quite a good article to discuss about the fate of Jokowi's dynasty so far:
1. His influence had waned to as far as the police and military, which awaited until their eventual retirements from their positions (with military is getting more closer with Prabowo for obvious reasons).
2. Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan (one of the closest Jokowi's allies) being positioned into a ceremonial role in National Economic Council.
3. Budi Arie, leader of ProJo faction got rejected here and there including from the Surakarta's chapter of Gerindra: a crucial base of support for Jokowi.
4. Bobby Nasution, Jokowi's son-in-laws faced a legal troubles such as briberies, corruptions, etc.
5. PSI and Jokowi relationship started to be questionable due to little interactions between them. Possibly with them not holding any seats in DPR, it started to become small in benefits for Jokowi's influence to be there.
6. Gibran position as a Vice President didn't give him any real power as not only he had been thrown to Papua, but the fact that Prabowo would rather relied on Gerindra and TNI to do his job instead of entrusting Gibran.
7. Eight individuals have been charged including Roy Suryo under accusations of slandering Jokowi's reputation due to forged diploma case. So far even Mahfud MD tried to defend Roy by saying he cannot be charged until it is proven whether the diploma is real or not.","","‼️ (3)"

1. With his international diplomacy, we can say that his recent speech in G20 for South Africa had turned out to be alright. He can try to gain electability through international missions.
2. His Papuan oversee tasks. This is the biggest challenge for Gibran considering he had to manage the Papuan regions to see whether the government projects are well conducted or not in the future. He has less than 3 years to achieve something from it to gain huge voter base from Papua into the election with the surrounding eastern areas of Indonesia.
3. His brother Kaesang made something significant happens to support Jokowi Dynasty again with PSI (still unsure about this).
4. He managed to convince Golkar and other allies to band together under him in 2029. This is due to Bahlil being the head of Golkar, even a sohib of Jokowi himself back in the younger days.","","‼️ (3)"

So during New Order, it was very Top-Down with central government coordinating economic development planning linked to regional development by gradual agglomerations in multiple cities and provinces in Indonesia, heavily orchestrated by Bappenas through Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun for
Mid term, and Garis Besar Haluan Negara for long term. Pretty much developmentalist

Right before 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Indonesia is pretty much benefitted with the oil boom, but unfortunately our profits from oil boom didn’t actually reinvest to our middle stream industries due to it’s actually cheaper to sell our crude oil to SG then let them processed for us. Unfortunately, we kinda leapfrogged to manufacture end products rather than focusing to excels in our middle stream due to “national pride” ***coughs in Habibie***

How about the regional development? We reallocate our the fund from regional development to funding finished products manufacturing capacity. Then 1997 crisis happened, we barely have any real economy other than extractive industries, then we reorient all of our focus to stabilize our monetary system; in which as the consequence, regional development is still neglected

From Habibie to SBY we are trying to fix our debts, and at last during 2004 Constitutional Amendments and 2009 Regional Autonomy Act; Regional development becomes our priority once again","","👍 (2)"
"575141979873083393","sukadeltoro","2025-12-06T07:12:04.0920000+00:00","But the question is, how restart our regional development IF we are lacking of fiscal capacity to do develop them? We give them power so they can develop their regions by themselves

But the difference is? Political systems

In Orba, every single interests groups and political parties are only allowed to wiggle in central government

For local gov? Nah

In reformasi, political parties and interest groups are allowed to operate in any levels of society, unlike in Orba (considering Golkar used to monopolize political participation in all levels because they were not actually a political party). With sudden shift in local politics, then it’s hunger games for all political parties and interest groups to seize and consolidate their powers in every region

There used to be only 3 parties who competed in central gov elections. Now? Multiple parties want to seize power in every regions. How to seize? By making sure every single resource they have to be weaponized against other actors

Starts from pork barreling to coopting prominent local community leaders to become dynasties. It’s kinda hard to fix the illegal ones, because it could risks ruling party’s electability in some regions; because the said regions wants their things for their own or to be weaponized.

It’s harder to fix the ***legal ones*** considering the said local actors weaponizing UU Otda for their own advantage

What about Jokowi and Prabowo? Revise UU Otda would be a political suicide, so they bypassing the local elites with weaponizing Kemenkoekonomi Debottlenecking Task Force, BKPM, Bappenas, and INA so overcome the red tapes and every political landmines which set up by local elites and potentially partisan operators

Tbh SBY already started his own version of SEZs, but not really working, so Jokowi kinda fixing it with more regulation and political power

TPP fails, so it’s only OBOR, we  tinkered it with RCEP; so investment to jumpstart the SEZs comes in","",""

1. revise UU Otda
2. Wins the local seats with people from ruling parties/coalition
3. BKPMmaxxing

We chose option 2 and 3, because UU Otda is very sensitive, but dynamics in local politics are different from national one

Most of them coming from family dynasties created from community leaders who owns provincial and municipal party offices and uhh ormas

The biggest problem is the weaponization of UU Otda by the local elites so they can have “passive incomes” 

It’s ***legal***

Alas, ruling parties and coalition in central gov’s room to control local elites is smaller than most of people would think","",""

1. It’s not fair for Indonesians when someone can reduce their jail sentence just because they have a lot of money. And honestly, it’s pretty obvious that they take it really seriously, but for me it’s not that big of a deal because you’re not harming anyone.
2.In my opinion, as long as they understand what consent means, then it’s fine.","","👍 (2)"

But 100% **shouldn’t** be criminalized, barring of if you’re the instigator, or other circumstances... 

No need to ban pornography websites from abroad countries where porn is legal, but the more I think about it, perhaps it isn’t wise to legalize the production and distribution of porn, produced here in the mainland.

Armed robbery, major financial fraud, and attempted murder? 2nd degree kinda thing.  Slapping someone for 15 years on “producing adult content”? Yeah no. 

Personally, I’m on the “regulate it, don’t let it run in the shadows” side. When it’s illegal, everything gets sketchy: exploitation, no worker protections, no health standards, none of that. When it’s legalized AND regulated, you can actually protect the people involved instead of pretending the whole industry doesn’t exist. Humans gonna human. Might as well make it safe.

But still, different countries = different moral codes, and Indonesia tends to be strict on anything related to sex work, they just can’t stop putting their noses in someone else’s pants, can they? Its somehow give them this moral pedestal, props themselves up like they’re the grand judge of righteousness. I friggin hate that, not to mention Indonesia ranked 14th globally for most adult site traffic DESPITE being all blocked by the isp.

In criminal law, you usually need **two things together**: 

1. mens rea (the guilty mind) and 
2. actus reus (the guilty act)
if you watched the show ""how to get away with murder"" this one is explained in the very beginning of the show lol.

**Mens rea** covers intent, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence. **Actus reus** is the actual behavior like, pulling the trigger. 

Example: if someone intends to kill** but never acts**, there’s *mens rea without actus reus* = *no crime*. If someone causes death with zero blameworthy mental state, like an executioner, there’s *actus reus without mens rea*, also usually no crime. Murder specifically needs intentional killing + an unlawful act. Take away “unlawful,” and it stops being murder.

That’s why executioners and doctors with DNRs aren’t criminals. The executioner has intent and causes death, but the act is lawful, so the “unlawful act” part is missing. A doctor following a DNR doesn’t even perform a killing act at all, they simply don’t intervene because the law removes their duty to act. No duty, no neglect, no actus reus.

Again, Intent alone doesn’t make someone a criminal. Law needs both the guilty mind and a guilty act. You can think about killing all day (terrible, but legal), but until you actually do something unlawful, there’s no crime. That’s why executioners aren’t jailed. yes, they intend to kill, but the act itself is legally authorized by the state.","","‼️ (3)"

> “is it right to intentionally kill, even with permission?”

Some moral frameworks say the executioner is morally responsible because they are still a human choosing to end another human’s life. From this view, state approval doesn’t magically wash the blood off your hands...

With all those said, *legally*, an executioner isn’t a murderer. Morally, whether they’re blameworthy depends entirely on which ethical lens you use, utilitarian, deontological, religious, or human-rights-based. Law answers “can we punish them?” Morality asks “can we live with this?” And those two questions almost never give the same answer.","",""

If we are going to define colonization, then we have to look up at three things that define colonization:
1. Settlement creation or resettling of people to fill these regions
2. Resource exploitations such as plantations, mining, oil drilling, etc
3. Colonial administrative buildings, including the installment of residents and local governors inside these regions.
(Add a few conversion attempts since early until late colonization did just that with churches or missionaries being sent to convert the local populace)

To support the arguments about not 350 years even further, I will put up more historical perspectives here.

There's also some slight misconception here historically that Java was the first island that got colonized. In 1619, although the Dutch (VOC) had taken Batavia, they had also taken the whole Ambon Island first, which by this stage, it is a trade outpost with a few forts (marked the first requirement of settlement creation for trade monopolies). By 1740, they controlled more eastern islands in Maluku than in Java as they mainly controlled East Java. At this point, the Dutch already created various infrastructures including plantations, mining and other resource colonial buildings, including its administrative.  By 1800, VOC had been nationalized to become a state controlled directly under the Dutch Crown (not anymore under the VOC). By early 1820's, they had controlled most of Java with a few vassals such as Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Mangkunegaran, and Pakualaman still exist as Mataram houses (retaining their autonomies though under the Dutch oversee, which made them into autonomous vassals). Now here's where things got interesting: vassalization is distinct from the definition of colonization. As a colony would not be able to retain any part of sovereignty as they were under the direct rule of a colonial power, but a vassal still retain a degree of autonomy from it.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-17T05:37:56.8620000+00:00","As such, we can say that rather than colonizing, the Dutch/VOC during its early eras were not in the interest of expanding colonization, but rather making sure that the profits of their interests still flow freely. Because yet again, we have to remind ourselves that colonization back in the day was a very hefty project. Most European powers created trade companies since most of the time, colonies were so expensive, that most European states would see it as counterproductive to their profit making schemes. As such, trade companies were being used as early colonial tools. Overtime, through the advancement of administration and technologies, the effort to directly control colonies under the state became possible as trade companies proved to be corrupt than profitable.

Later expeditions like Sumatra and Kalimantan in 1820's to 1830's wasn't exactly a colonization attempt either at first, but a bunch of expeditions and contract making to curb local influences in ensuring that they still hold the influence within the trade routes. Before 1870, the control of Dutch East Indies were still pretty incomplete. The people at that time didn't called themselves Nusantaran or even Indonesians, but rather their own ethnic groups (Javanese, Sundanese, Malay, Acehnese, etc). The word Nusantara mainly exist as an old Javanese manuscript back in Majapahit period, most famously used by Gajah Mada in his Sumpah Palapa.","",""

But again, most of the people that announced that they were Indonesians most covered Java and Sumatra islands, with a few covered some eastern parts of modern Indonesia such as Ambon and Celebes, while most of Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua didn't really have their representatives that were present to declared themselves as Indonesians.

Hak queer dan agama minoritas buat aku ga perlu didebatin lagi.
They are valid. Period. Sebagai manusia juga pantas diperlakukan setara. Dan ga di judge berdasarkan identitas. Tapi berdasarkan perbuatannya. (Baru kepikiran klo perilaku jd ada celah)
Tapi.. gimana cara bikin argumen yg solid, kuat, dan damai?

Untuk yg queer, jd klo didebat soal ayat agama, mereka punya pegangan solid. Ga perlu bingung, atau second guess themselves (klo km udh ngga, bangga bgt ❤️✨)

Tp mungkin aku aga ketinggalan 😅
Apa udah ada yg punya argumennya? Selain hak asasi manusia..

Aku ga tau hukum di Indonesia dan di dunia kayak gimana. Apakah perasaan manusia punya validitas yg sama dengan logika.
Yg aku tau data dan bisa hitung jumlah korban. Tapi logika ga bisa ngerasain perasaan setiap korban yg kedinginan, kelaparan, ketakutan, dll.
Yg aku tangkep, selama ini seni juga dianggap sebagai luxury.. atau aksesoris. Entertainment.  Bukan sesuatu yg punya validitas yg sama dengan logika, matematika, dll. Tapi lewat seni, manusia jadi punya medium untuk mencoba artikulasiin perasaan abstrak yg jiwa manusia bisa rasain. Binatang dan mahluk hidup lain bisa rasain.
Tapi teknologi ga bisa kalkulasiin. Ga bisa kuantifikasi.","","👍 (2)"

1. Domestically speaking: Regime is a system which is built by people with vested interests and flexible belief systems within it, not just merely a cult personality oriented to a certain individual, especially in a flawed democracy which turned into an authoritarian; as long you can capture the elites’ interests, the system remains working or at least the bureaucracy still working

2. Foreign policy wise, if you acted fast and surgical enough without creating a spillover to the neighbors; the worst thing you will receive is just a written complaint about basic international norms, but deep down in most of foreign leadership’s brain trusts/analytical shop’s mind; Maduro is just a nuisance in regional politics

3. Economically speaking, still got things to do in national-level, especially oil concessions and some basic public service provisions. However, in subnational-level, they’re quite resilient due to being accustomed with their existing conditions for 3-6 months until new provisions by new leadership (Maria) comes 

4. Military-Security speaking, kinda aligned with number 1, they will try to make things stable until new political leadership arrives. Possibly they will receive some US troops and occasionally some manageable low-level conflicts with the US troops. If Trump and likeminded leaderships in Latam decided to create OAS peacekeepers or something, it’s more appealing than US troops. Border areas remain unstable and ridden with criminal activities, yet it depends on the incoming new political leadership. Most of short term threats coming from loyalist areas like from Maduro public housing areas and colectivos

5. Democratically speaking, VZ already has institutions and people’s support to make democracy happens. Probably we will see US or/and OAS will empower the political parties and oppositions to take post-Maduro political void and some forms of something akin to Debaathization happening","","👍 (1)"

Alot, and i mean alot of Indonesians cannot discern what is objective and subjective, they inherently believe the opinion that they stand by is objectively correct, and will antagonize if anyone does not agree to their ideal or opinon, stemming from an enviroment that supports a notion.

I might take this example that can trigger some of you, but the clearest example would be : you're not an active worshiper of god? ---> you're the lowest of the low

It acts as a cult, believing the actions are justified so long as they worship a god, god permits them, and god advocating for them, an very extremist and irrational conclusion simply by the appeal.  it antagonizes anyone who doesn't worship and will use _any_ method to scrutinized, which infringes on the lessons , in their mind, it will :

1) Make them realize they're on the 'wrong' path (when they never gone down that path assuming the person itself has never go against the teaching of religion they are in, and moral & ethics)

2) Scrutinized, Antagonize, and Exile them, as god does forbid anyone to break the rules of its teaching, the irrational conclusion would be that, that person sides with the devil, forbidden/haram stuff will increase sin---> any form of sin will lead to hell therefore that person is bad (by breaking the rules of its teaching, its the general outline, like not worshipping/solat 5 waktu for any reason)

Forgetting the fact that methods like these are forbidden and immoral, and does increase your sin whether or not you worship god hard enough, the teachings itself _explicitly told you_ that these things are forbidden for a reason, and breaking one doesn't necessarilly make you a bad person,  it only harms you or the people around you, and **god is not an idiot**, there will always be circumstances, exceptions, and actual rational understanding and reasoning, including background checks of how and why the teachings are teached.","",""

- Black-and-White Thinking
Human cultures and religions enjoy using polar opposites to categorize things. Good and bad, right and wrong. This attitude is simple to understand but brings a lot of issues down the line. Notice how it is used in the bible:
> ""Thou shalt have no other gods before Me"" - Exodus 20:3
The way I see it, this passage implies that *My God is right, all other Gods are wrong*.

Many other teachings also has this same attitude:
> In the after-life, you'd either have eternal suffering in hell, or eternal peace in heaven.
> If you do good things, you'll go to heaven. Otherwise, you'll go to hell.
> This action is good, that action is bad.


- The Humanization of God
God is often treated like a figure. A being who would act according to its own will. Notice the language that people use:
> ""Tuhan mengasihi kita""
> ""Bapa ialah gembala dan kita adalah dombanya""

They view God like they would another human. This in turn, led to people making assumptions on God.
*I feel terrible when someone I trust does this action, therefore God must feel the same if I do this.*

Inevitably, you'll find people who makes justification on their actions based on their own assumptions of God","",""

People make the assumption that god is treated like a figure, and not an incomprehensible being that is alligning with out rationality so that we can comprehend, people often forget that the more logic we try to explain about god, the less it makes sense, and that framing causes assumptions

Black and white thinking also stems from doctrines, it is a hasty generalization of categories that does not include spectrums of morality","",""

I disagree. 
I worked in a bank in Aus and we had so many protocols - one being we are not allowed to access ChatGPT from our work laptops (in fact it was black listed due to the fact that people could upload sensitive customer data). 


I also worked in FinTech where we were not allowed to have AI in our product due to strict regulations. We can leverage LLM but had to have human in the loop and we were told that it cannot replace humans.","","👍🏻 (2)"

1. How much water is used per year?
Recent research from the University of California, Riverside, and the University of Texas at Arlington provides a clear picture of the scale:
    •    Global Consumption: It is estimated that global AI demand could reach 4.2 to 6.6 billion cubic meters (roughly 1.1 to 1.7 trillion gallons) of water withdrawal by 2027.
    •    Per-Query Basis: Every time you ask an AI 10 to 50 questions, it ""drinks"" about 500ml (one standard water bottle).
    •    The Big Tech Footprint: In 2022 alone, Microsoft, Google, and Meta combined withdrew roughly 2.2 billion cubic meters of water—enough to fill over 800,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.","","📝 (2)"

Depends on the type of cooling system the data center uses. There are two main ways ""coolant"" is handled:
A. Evaporative Cooling (The ""Open"" System)
In these systems, the water is designed to evaporate.
    •    How it works: Hot air from the servers is passed through wet pads or sprayed with water. As the water evaporates, it absorbs heat, cooling the air.
    •    Result: This water is lost to the local environment. It turns into water vapor and exits through cooling towers. This is the most common method because it is cheap and energy-efficient, but it is the most water-intensive.
B. Closed-Loop Cooling
In these systems, the ""coolant"" is a specialized fluid (often ultrapure water) that stays inside pipes.
    •    How it works: It’s exactly like a car radiator. The fluid picks up heat from the chips, travels to a heat exchanger where it is cooled by fans or a separate water line, and then loops back.
    •    Result: The coolant does not evaporate. However, these systems still require a ""secondary"" source of water.

3. How much water is required to sustain this?
To sustain the current growth of AI without crashing local ecosystems, the ""Sustainability Math"" requires three things:
    •    Replenishment Rates: Data centers shouldn't withdraw more than 100% of the natural recharge rate of their local aquifer. In ""water-stressed"" regions (like Mesa, Arizona), the amount of water required to sustain a data center often exceeds what the local environment can provide naturally.
    •    The ""Purity"" Cost: To get 1 gallon of Ultrapure Water (required for chips and closed loops), you often need to process 1.5 to 2 gallons of raw water. The ""waste"" (brine) is often too salty to be put back into the ground easily.
    •    Power Plant Water: To sustain the electricity for AI, we need roughly 15 to 20 times more water than what is used on-site at the data center. This is used by the massive turbines at power plants.","",""

You need to look at a bigger picture, if only youre the only one using, then theres no harm. But *millions* of them normalize substitution. The notion that “Oh, visuals are just infinite and free now.” Is what is harmful, Think of it like plastic straws. One straw? Whatever. A billion? Now it’s a thing.

Another thing is that If someone uses AI for a thing they might have otherwise commissioned—that’s a missed micro-opportunity for an artist.

ethics don’t really hinge on the tool itself. They hinge on displacement, and deception. Gen-AI art becomes unethical when a powerful entity uses it to replace paid artists purely to cut costs, OR when AI-generated work is passed off as human-made, or when a specific living artist’s recognizable style is deliberately replicated  (wink wink ghibli)

Individual users like you and i don’t operate at scale, but corporations and institutions do. When AI is deployed widely without transparency, the harm multiplies. 

On your generated art you posted, using gen-AI for personal projects, clearly labeled social media posts, **non-commercial** trends, concept arts, or experimentation is not inherently unethical, especially when it replaces nothing that would have been commissioned in the first place.

Balik lagi, sebener nya what people are often really reacting to isn’t the ethics of usage, but the fear of being replaced and losing creative livelihoods. That fear is valid, you have to mention this, but it’s a labor and policy problem, not something that can be solved by demanding individual moral purity from users.

So the bottom line is this: gen-AI art isn’t unethical by nature. It becomes unethical depending on who is using it, for what purpose, at what scale, and with what level of transparency and accountability.","","❤️ (2),👆🏻 (1)"

1. It looks like a bad CGI and exudes the uncanny valley effect
2. They consider it unfair for you to be able to create a full-blown art work with little to no effort
3. They consider it unfair for other artists who put in a lot of work just for their hard work to be used without them being paid in return

I am convinced that people are just trying to shoehorn the idea of ""unethical"" because they consider it unfair, and yet they are willing to overlook many other things. People pirates games, photoshop, and other applications and no one really cares. People are openly fine with using AI to generate text despite it being trained on countless books. People don't think twice about buying cheap clothes even if there's a good chance that it is manufactured in exploitative sweatshops. Many Indonesians enjoy watching anime, but they don't really care if the people working on it are treated like slaves except for the times when it went viral. Again, no one cares unless it is blatantly obvious no?

Use AI as long as people don't notice it. I think the key factor to people hating your post is:
- It's 100%  made by AI which makes it very obvious.
- It's an artwork, which is one of the easiest thing for a person to differentiate between AI and human art.","","❤️ (1)"

Marx isn't an economist, in the bourgeois sense, he didn't study political economy his raison d'etre and main point on capital came not from an area to improve, quite the opposite, it came from hus critique of political economy. you cannot take Marx's critique of the economy as a continuity of past economist theoretician before him; say smith and ricardo. Marx's main critique in capital of capitalist production and capitalist social relation was borne out of the critique of those processes. capitalism degenerate mans species-being (gattungwesen, the closest thing to a ""theory of human nature"" posthumously attributed to Marx"".

Now going into communism's supposed incompatibility w the real observable tangible world. in order to make this argument compelling in the first place is to acknowledge God, to acknowledge mans never changing characteristics. Man is not the static wave of the universe, just as Marxism is not a doctrine of the economy or the doctrine of political governance, it is a methodology, a forever enriching methodology, to fully realize communism is both to acknowledge the theory and practice of it, this is the complete understanding of the methodology. it is not a doctrine, a science, or a philosophy, it is (going back to the first point) a critique, a ruthless critique of everything that exist.","",""
