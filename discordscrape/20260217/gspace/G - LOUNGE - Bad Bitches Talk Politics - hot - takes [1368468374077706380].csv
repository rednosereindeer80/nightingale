i get tho for years and centuries men have been in the centre of bad thing however, im beginning to think that this constant cycle of ""I hate men lol"" posts is simply a low-level indulgence that goes nowhere. It's similar to screaming at a brick wall and hoping it will improve itself. 

this the agreement: The majority of males are not sinister geniuses. they are chronically deprived of validation, emotionally inhibited, and have been taught from a young age that being vulnerable is a sign of weakness and being dominant is a sign of strength. 

unprocessed grief, anxiety, self hatred, and fear repackaged as ego, silence, or violence is what we frequently refer to as ""toxic masculinity."" 

perhaps we should channel our anger instead of making memes out of it and not for them, but for us and men must be held accountable if we want healthier relationships, safer communities, and better sons. however, they also require therapy, emotional literacy, and practical advice on how to improve as people. 
endlessly mocking them for not knowing how to feel and then getting angry when they lash out or implode is just lazy activism. 

men shouldn't be hated but they should be made to connect with their inner child who wasn't permitted to weep.

Legalisation brings safer products, less criminalisation, and more tax revenue no argument there.

but here’s the thing: just because it’s legal doesn’t mean i want to inhale it everywhere i go.

living in a place where people can smoke freely in public, i’ve realised the reality isn’t as chill as it sounds. the smell is intense it clings to clothes, hair, and lingers long after the joint is gone. It’s like cigarette smoke, but stronger and harder to escape. Getting on a bus next to someone who just lit up is annoying and plus there can be kids and elderly that can be sensitive to it and worse it gives me migraines the and it’s not-about being anti-weed its about not being forced to experience someone else’s high just by existing in the same space.

wedon’t allow open alcohol on public transport or cigarettes in indoor spaces anymore, so why is public weed smoking treated differently?

legal doesn’t mean anywhere, anytime and it’s  time we talk about basic etiquette or designated smoking areas bcs enjoying weed shouldn’t come at the cost of everyone else’s comfort — or health.

We’ve legalised weed. Cool. Now let’s legalise some courtesy. @G CAT (Indah G)","","💯 (1)"

i think we cant assume the good things of safer products and decriminalization without a coherent plan and a well thought out program
legalising something that is this easily diverted and clandestinely produced only on selected specific use cases (that we know wont be accessible anyways like the rest of the healthcare system) opens up a parallel legal and illegal ecosystem
when taxation is involved the war on drugs will evolve according to this new ecosystem
even in places of total prohibition, the war on drugs (or honestly any type of criminality with the opportunity to be organised) revolves around untaxed criminal income
in places like canada people will buy untaxed ilicit adulterated weed because they are motivated to both by legitimate and whatever you think are illegitimate reasons
they will ultimately be criminalised over taxes regardless if the reasons are considered legit or they wont be even if its ""pointless"" recreation just because its taxed from a legal dispensary","",""

Hmmmm this just doesn't add up.

Like man, WNBA is constantly in the red and has to be funded by the NBA. This will reflect in the players' pay. Male athletes can get contracts of up to millions of dollars, while women players are lucky if they hit 6 digits.

I'd even hazard a guess that the least paid player in the NBA is still paid comfortably more than the most paid player in the WNBA.","","‼️ (1)"

Stuff like Gymnastics, Synchronized Swimming, Figure Skating women perform significantly at a high level, perhaps at an ability that's equal to, or superior to men. So what I'm thinking is: people are drawn to high levels of performance and quality. To get them to watch women sports, it would need to be of high quality, perhaps comparable to men's sports. To do so, it is paramount to support women should they want to pursue sport.

But this is a chicken/egg debate here, because most of the women will not want to do sport just for the love of the game, they need it to be a level of profitable as well, being a female sports athlete might not be good financially career wise, leading to less people and less talent pool, leading to less sponsorships, less pay, and lessening the pool more and more. Inversely, if there are a lot of people who want to be an athlete, and continuously improve their craft, it will draw more eyes, and it will result in more sponsorships, leading to higher pay, which leads to more people wanting to be athletes.","","💯 (1)"

A problem about GenZ, this demonstration was supported by America and other western imperialism.

I am very sceptical about the appointment of the new Prime Minister. Just because she is a woman does not mean that this is progress. I am sceptical about her real fight against corruption. I do not deny that corruption exists, but where does it come from? Her appointment has been welcomed by the European Union in order to maintain its European imperialist power. His appointment was also welcomed by India's far right. The US approves of the same thing. The more I learn, the more I see that Gen Z has been well funded by pro-Western organisations to disrupt the legacy of the Nepalese revolution that took place between 1995 and 2008.

Nepal is a buffer state between China and the US in terms of geopolitical tensions. Oli, the outgoing Prime Minister, is known for his pro-China stance, as he knows he cannot rely on imperialist powers to bring national projects to fruition. Oli is renowned for opposing the Indian threat. The Indian government advocates Hindu supremacy and hegemony. 

This is not the first time that the NEP or the CIA have financed chaos and false revolutions to overthrow governments that oppose imperialism and Western powers.

This is what your country has been suffering since the era of Suharto, who overthrew Sukarno, the father of Indonesian independence. It is sad to see how Indonesia still bears heavy scars, heavy consequences of Suharto's policies, which severely persecuted Indonesian Chinese, Christians, moderate Muslims, the vast majority of communists, Hindus, and more broadly, non-Muslims. The massacre of 1965–1966 is truly abominable and terrifying. When I see how people were targeted, it is almost genocide. Other ethnic and religious minorities too. Especially when you consider how incredibly rich Indonesia is in terms of ethnic diversity. This country deserves better, deserves to evolve in a positive way, with the fight against poverty, tolerance of diversity and modernity that benefits both the population and nature. In my opinion, it is truly one of the most beautiful and incredible multi-ethnic countries, along with China, Vietnam and India.

If anything, the phenonenon of people dating the same friends, same exes, same brunch table, same X — I think that’s less to do with social economic status and more to do with culture. 

Indonesian culture places high emphasis on homogeneity and monoliths. You especially see this with Chinese-Indonesians, which is the only cultural experience I get to speak on cause, duh.","","👍 (3),🤝 (3)"

It's hard to socialize with someone with lower social/economic class mainly because sometimes it's just a lil bit awkward. While I've never grew up rich (just comfortable enough I guess?) I do have some friends within the lower social/economic class than me and sometimes it would bug me when the blush over things I have and they couldn't. Even worse, I've had some that tried to take advantage of me financially.

On the flip side, I also have some friends/family members that's richer than me and I'd have to admit that sometimes I envy them or just think that they're so comfortable with their finance situations that they don't really care about the money value whereas I'd have to think about every single expense.

**TL;DR** 
Most of the times our financial situations, especially the one we grew up in, will effect our social life too. There are things that we are so used to and couldn't imagine how other people survive without it, and it goes both ways, we'd wonder why some people would need things in their life that we see as unnecessary. Which is why some are more comfortable to mingle within their own social class.","","👍 (3),‼️ (3)"

The answer isn’t “don’t use tech,” it’s “use it consciously.” Guilt doesn’t change the world, innovation does

It’s true that AI systems (like most tech) use energy and resources — data centers do consume a lot of electricity and water for cooling. But that doesn’t mean using AI makes you a bad person or hypocritical. It’s the same as liking air conditioning, streaming movies, or using your phone — all of which also have environmental costs.

The key is being aware of the impact, not guilt-tripping yourself for using tools that genuinely help or inspire you. You can appreciate the convenience or creativity AI gives you and still care about sustainability — those two things can coexist","","‼️ (3)"
