tapi wajib pelajaran bahasa inggris ada dan pada saat itu kurikulum KTSP 2006, KTSP 2013 sebelum kurikulum merdeka hadir. 
untuk mulai pelajaran bahasa inggris sediri sudah ada dari kelas 1SD kemudian SMP, SMA / SMK itu sudah ada tetapi hanya basic, like number, alphabet, kata kerja v1, v2,v3. kata sifat, etc (menyesuikan lv di sekolahnya). tidak ada / tidak wajib conversation sehari hari pakai bahasa inggris. jadi seperti hapalan ini yang membuat siswa tidak bisa mengembangakan bahasa inggris karna tidak pernah conversation. dan ketika memulai mereka akan di anggap sok inggris wkwk

jika di compare sama sekolah negri sekarang kurikulum merdeka rasa rasanya sangat turun drastis untuk pendidikan di indonesia, terutama bahasa inggris di sekolah negri karna berbeda jauh sekali dengan ktsp pada saat itu apalagi jika di compare dengan sekolah cambridge sangat jauh berbeda 😁","","👍 (1)"

Kritik untuk Bang Timothy (Dengan Hormat dan Tanpa Maksud Menyinggung)

Maaf ya Bang sebelumnya, aku nggak ada niat untuk menjelekkan atau menyerang pribadi Abang. Aku cuma ingin menyampaikan sedikit kritik dari perspektifku, semoga bisa jadi bahan refleksi bersama.

Jadi aku sempat dengar Bang Timothy pernah bilang bahwa kuliah bisnis itu ""scam"". Terus Abang juga pernah cerita bareng Bang Kalimasada soal dosen yang katanya jualan tapi bangkrut, dan itu dijadikan semacam bahan ketawaan atau bukti bahwa kuliah bisnis nggak berguna.

Menurutku, pandangan itu agak kurang adil, Bang.

Kenapa?

Karena seseorang mengalami kegagalan dalam bisnis tidak otomatis berarti dia tidak kompeten dalam bidang bisnis secara keseluruhan. Ilmu bisnis itu luas — mencakup manajemen risiko, pemasaran, keuangan, perilaku konsumen, dan lain-lain. Gagal di praktik bukan berarti gagal dalam memahami teori atau menyampaikan pengetahuan ke orang lain.

Kita juga harus hati-hati membedakan antara ""korelasi"" dan ""kausalitas"". Fakta bahwa ada dosen bisnis yang bangkrut bukan bukti langsung bahwa semua pengajaran bisnis itu palsu atau sia-sia. Bisa saja dosen tersebut punya pengetahuan yang baik, tapi mengalami faktor eksternal yang tak terduga — seperti pandemi, fraud partner, atau perubahan pasar yang ekstrem.

Justru menurutku, ketika seseorang pernah mengalami kegagalan, dia bisa punya insight yang lebih realistis dan praktikal untuk dibagikan — asal dia reflektif dan jujur terhadap prosesnya.

Jadi kalau aku boleh kasih masukan: semoga ke depannya kita bisa lebih hati-hati dalam menyampaikan generalisasi, supaya tidak terkesan meremehkan usaha orang lain — apalagi di dunia akademik yang sebenarnya banyak nuansanya.

Terima kasih banyak sudah mau dengar. 🙏","",""

Jadi begini , 
Bisa benar apabila seorang gurunya itu emang males malesan ngajarnya sehingga waktu yang diperlukan untuk mengajar yang seharusnya dapat ditangkap dalam waktu 2 hari oleh anak tapi menjadi 30 hari , karena daya pengajarannya buruk.

Tapi , apabila maksud abang timothy ini belajar materi sekolah dalam waktu singkat sebetulnya itu salah bang. Kenapa ? karena daya tangkap orang beda - beda , ada yang fast learner dan medium learner even slow learner.

Begitu bang. Terima kasih","",""
