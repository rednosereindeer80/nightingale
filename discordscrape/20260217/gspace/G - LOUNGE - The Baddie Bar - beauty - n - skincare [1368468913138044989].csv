hi tourmaline! -about to geek bc perfumes is a topic that excites me, esp arab perfumes- 

i highly suggest you get a genuine musk from AbdulSamad AlQurashi, you can order it online from their official web, if im not mistaken they ship worldwide.
perfect arabian usage? 
scrub, shower, then use a body oil - preferably not a strong scent or unscented and you'll add a bit of musk, mix it with your body oil in the palm of your hand 
- gotta be quick btw
you rub that all over your body especially at pulse points, and then layer it with a french perfume or any favourite perfume of your choice. you'll smell divine. you're welcome in advance! 🤍","",""

Pay Raise perfume by Noseknows it's by far my favourite local perfume
WHICH SMELLS SO GOOD WITH OUD BUKHOOR (y'all look up bukhoor, it's arabian incense) 
but about a quarter of the bottle is left because the perfume spilled in my bag and on my abaya (arabian outter clothes) 🥴💔

these two western perfumes:
212 VIP Rosé by Carolina Herrera - so good and has a pretty strong sillage and wear longevity

Her Body EDP by Burberry
