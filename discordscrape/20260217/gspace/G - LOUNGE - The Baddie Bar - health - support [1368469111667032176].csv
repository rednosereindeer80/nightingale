I've been seriously thinking about cutting ties with them. I mean, if they call me a ""Anak Durhaka"", so be it, right? I haven't even replied to their chats for the past 10 days.

I've been living separately from my parents for a while now. They're in Bogor, and I'm in an apartment in Jakarta. 

My dad's in his 70s, and my mom's in her late 50s. I'm my mom's only child; she's my dad's second wife (he divorced his first wife when he was young). From my dad's side, I'm his third child.

Anyway, my dad's hooked on online gambling. It's so hard to talk sense into him, even his own family can't get through to him.

Three years ago, my paternal grandparents passed away and left a pretty substantial inheritance to their kids. If they'd just lived normally, even a bit extravagantly, it would have been more than enough. But in just three years, my dad blew it all on gambling and now he's in the red. The only asset left is their house, which they're trying to sell because I hear there are debts everywhere – I'm not sure of the exact amount. My dad's car (BPKB) is also pawned at the bank for a loan. And it seems like the money from that car loan is gone, and he can't even make the payments anymore. 

Now, they're chasing me to help them pawn my car's (BPKB) at the bank for another loan for my dad. They promise they'll pay it back when the house sells, they buy a smaller one, and pay off all their debts.

I'm not replying because I absolutely do not want my car's BPKB pawned at the bank. The risk of default is super high, and it feels like they're just digging a deeper hole. If they default, my BI Checking (credit score) will be screwed because it's under my name, and I feel like I'll need a good BI Checking for everything in my future.","","🩷 (1)"
"243443816814608385","dzmiguel","2025-05-29T08:46:02.8240000+00:00","Their house has been listed for sale for about six months now, and honestly, I don't think it'll sell anytime soon. The location isn't great – it's in a housing complex but in the back. Plus, the price is pretty high, so it's tough to sell, especially with the current economy.

That's why I think it's bullshit that they'll pay off all their debts once the house sells. It'll take forever, or it might not even sell at all.

And now, on top of the bank stuff, my dad also has debts with a bunch of relatives, like here and there, close and distant family, it seems he owes money to a lot of them, and it's just coming out more and more. So yeah, for sure this thing about borrowing my car's BPKB, there's no way it'll get paid back, it's just to dig himself into an even bigger hole. 

When they first bought that house with his inheritance money, I was against it. It was overpriced and far from everything, but my father insisted. I could only give advice; there was nothing else I could do, it was his money anyway. So I didn't really care.

Now it's just making my life complicated; they keep messaging me.","","🩷 (1)"

Even though I haven't ""made it"" yet and my work is a bit all over the place, I can survive living on my own in Jakarta. Right now, I work as a ride-share driver, a plane ticket broker, handle driving licenses, ETLE (electronic traffic law enforcement), visas, etc. There are always ways to survive in Jakarta. You can still find cheap food, like 10-15k Rupiah meals at warteg (local eateries), and I'm always looking for promotions. When I used to live with them, they never supported any of my business ideas, saying ""why do that, why start that business, you'll just lose money."" My dad had it easy back then with my grandparents around to support him, always hoping for that inheritance. Now my grandparents are gone, and the inheritance is gone too, all vanished because of gambling.

I just wanted to share my story here.
For those of you who are thinking about getting married or are looking for a partner, please find someone who is truly good, doesn't gamble, and is responsible.
Because otherwise, your kids will end up carrying the family's burdens and stress.
I feel lucky that this problem came up now that I live alone. I can truly ignore all calls and chats from my parents. If I were still living with them, it would be a total nightmare.
It's exhausting having parents like that, but I'm still trying to stay strong. I really want to blow up the whole situation to the extended family so they know what my parents are really like. But I'm still holding back.

Basically, don't get married if you're not ready mentally either, because your kids will pay the price.

Stay strong, everyone!
Sorry this is so long. I don't know where else to share this. I'm still not brave enough to post it on my personal Facebook or Instagram because there's a lot of family there. Here, I can be half anonymous.
Thanks!","","❤️ (4),💡 (1)"

- Idealistic Procrastination
Basically holding off from doing something because I want to ""wait for the right moment"". Perfectionism falls under this category.
> *""I am supposed to to this assignment, but right now I'm not feeling inspired/motivated so I'll only start doing it after I feel better.""*
> 
> *""I really lonely and want to find someone, but I'm not confident in myself so I'll only start looking after I have a (good job)/(better body after going to the gym)/(better appearance after consistent skincare and get better clothing).""*

- Avoidance Procrastination
Procrastination in order to avoid/postpone a negative emotion.
> *""I know I have to finish my college work, but the work is incredibly boring and the last assignment I completed did not even get a good grade so why bother? I'd do anything to avoid boredom.""*
> 
> *""I want to open up to my parents on my suicidal thoughts due to me believing that I'm a failure, but I'm scared that they'll see me differently because of it. I'm scared that I'll become a bigger burden to them""*

- Operational Procrastination
Procrastination because the task I'm supposed to be doing is too abstract. Usually happens for tasks that needed to be broken down into practical steps, for example:
> I'm supposed to begin writing my thesis. But I don't even have the slightest idea what needs to be prepared and what the steps are. In the end, I'd procrastinate simply because I don't know what tangible action I could do today.

Being able to notice & identify all the friction my mind makes which caused procrastination is really difficult","","👍 (2),❤️ (2)"

A few minutes ago, I just had a serious conversation with my bf, who said he wanted to marry me a few months ago,  already contacted my parents, and I'd gotten to know his family well. But after learning about my symptoms of BPD, he changed his mind and said something hurtful about my BPD. I'm crying in the bathroom rn, feeling incredibly sad. It's as if he can break the commitment bcs I can't be mentally stable (which takes a long time to recover).

Not only you lost a future that youre ready to go into, but also being hurt in identity-level kind of way. We’re glad that you choose to say something about it, anyone in your position would be wrecked 💔

Let me say this clearly, because your brain is being cruel to you right now:
**Having BPD symptoms does not make you unlovable, disposable, or unworthy of commitment.**

It means you’re human, dealing with something real, and healing takes time. That’s not a flaw, okay? 

About what he said, this is my personal opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I think it crossed a line. It’s one thing to feel scared or unprepared. It’s another thing to weaponize your mental health and make it sound like you are the problem. That doesn’t mean you’re “too much.” It means he didn’t have the capacity he thought he did. 

“If people say ‘don’t end your life,’ why hasn’t anyone stayed?”

Yeah. Sometimes people are loud about wanting us alive but quiet when it comes to showing up. **That’s a failure on them, not proof that your life isn’t worth staying for.**

Right now, please focus on one thing only: you are not alone in this moment, even if it feels like it. 

You don’t need to solve your relationship tonight.
You don’t need to decide your worth tonight.
You just need to get through this hour.

**P.s. You are worthy of love that doesn’t disappear when things get hard.** Even if your heart can’t believe that yet, it’s still true.","","❤️ (2)"

If your partner cannot accept it, that was his own decision as you took the right decision. Your bf and your friends don't have the capacity to accept it (as Latte had explained it very well).

As someone who lives with BPD, i do understand how you feel, and what shibe and latte says are right, don't blame yourself either, you are you, and I'm sure that the things you did are not caused by you, but your BPD, and even then, now that you know you have it, you know that it isnt you who is willingly wanting to become like this.

I dont know who you are personally, but i'm glad youre still here with us to tell, and, this is gonna sound very counterintuitive and i dont mean this in a bad way, but now that your bf (or ex if thats the case) has shown his true colours, it is clear to you that it could've ended worse if you discover it later on.

It's so incredibly callous and unfair, and honestly it says a lot about who he is, what his values are, his attitude towards the topic of mental health, and also his conflict resolution skills (which clearly, are shit).

You are always worthy of love and support, don't let one man make you forget that. I know lots of people with BPD (@amiyazo, @cwk | angerypdd...) and they are able to live fruitful, fulfilled and flourishing lives once they do get that love and support from the people around them.

I just want to release some of my emotions to real people, not only to ChatGPT.
I’m kind of disappointed in myself. For three months I stopped slfhrming, but last night I did it again  and it was worse.
Lately I’ve been carrying a lot of mental burden, going through a really hard time, and what’s worse, I just realized my medication is about to expire 🥲
I have bf, and I know he loves me, but he doesn’t have experience dealing with people who have mental health issues, and he feels stressed bcs he doesn’t know how to handle me. I told him to find another girl, but instead he wants to marry me at the end of Dec.
Sometimes I realize I need other people in my life bcs it’s more dangerous when I’m alone, but when I’m with someone I struggle to find peace bcs of my overthinking. And it doesn’t feel fair to expect them to be my caregiver.","","❤️ (1),🫂 (1)"
