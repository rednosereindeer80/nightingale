Hot take: I actually support Dedi Mulyadi's proposal, I think the poor need to be incentivized to stop having children, and that until they are able to reach a level of  financial security, a government-subsidized reversible vasectomy done by qualified surgeons, and obviously paired with open-communication, education, transparency of conditions + consent to T&C is the most effective way to go.

Hot take:
We don’t live to chase happiness—we live to pursue life itself.
When you only seek happiness, you tend to stay in your comfort zone, avoiding discomfort and risk. But real life is a mix of highs and lows—joy, sadness, struggle, and growth.
It’s through those full, raw experiences that life becomes meaningful.
Don’t just chase happiness. Live fully.

Hot take: god I have so many. Imma start with a mild one: religion is a social construct, some people want to believe in a greater power for them to essentially ""be guided"". It gives some people purpose, and the promise of afterlife is reassuring for some people. That being said, the ""greater power"" aforementioned might not even ""exist"".

Hot take: I'm personally against abortion but I am pro-choice. I think the choice should be available and considered legal but with clear guidelines, meaning there should be consultations, other options offered, and follow up medical check. Not having it legalized could be dangerous because some women can't even handle of the shame of having a baby out of wedlock, they could sort to dangerous alternatives. And unless it's a direct adoption where the baby would be adopted right after birth, there's just no way to guarantee they will have a good quality of life and future outlook.

Hot take:  If men had been the ones to get pregnant, birth control would’ve been perfected decades ago. It wouldn’t be a pill or a shot. It’d be a gummy vitamin that tastes like blue raspberry or comes in 30 different flavors, and has zero side effects. And it would’ve been free at every gas station by now. The only reason birth control is still this complicated is because women are the ones carrying the burden.

Name: Cal
Pronouns: He/Him
MBTI: INTJ-A
Occupation: (almost) high school graduate
From: Serang (Domicile: Tangerang)
Ethnicity: Sundanese
Languages: English, Indonesian, and beginner-intermediate level German and Japanese
Interest: video games (sometimes), all-genre music enjoyer and loves to read books about History, Politics, Philosophy
Political stance: personally I'd say a fine balance between left and right. Thus centrist

Hot Take: politics these days are tumultuous, divisive, and unstable. People keep choosing sides on the political spectrum (ik, in the end we're gonna have to choose a side but ykwim) but not a lot of people seem to understand the flaw behind every political stance (ex: communism, capitalism, etc).

So to overcome this, wouldn't it be nice to simply think pragmatically in implementing national policies that offer long term growth and stability while fulfilling the needs of the people? I think we all must strive for the common good, to put reason before personal desire, and above all **work together as a community and to love one's nation**","","❤️ (2)"

I'm type of people that happy to be the part of conversation/tongkrongan but didn't say a word. It doesn't mean i'm arrogant, but i didn't know how to enter the conversation without being awkward, And FYI i'm type of socially awkward person hehehe

Hot takes : I have very strong stance about conscious marriage / relationship concept. It mean before you're build a romantic relationship, you must aware about the consquence and accepting your significant others. You can learn more with ibu Rani Anggraeni she's amazing marriage counselor.

And one more thing, me and my wife want to spent the elderhood life in retirement centre/panti jompo with 5 star facility⭐","","❤️ (2)"
