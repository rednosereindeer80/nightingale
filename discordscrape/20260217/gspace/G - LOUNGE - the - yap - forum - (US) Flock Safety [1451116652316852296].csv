Apparently by some council meeting and pushes across cities like Austin (where Louis Rossmann live) we got a lot of unknown fuckers trying to spy on every cars and citizens using AI powered BS. The company goes by the name of Flock Safety. This piece of shit surveillance company is trying to make ""people behave differently"" by installing surveillance cameras across the US by pushing the city council like in Austin to acknowledge and accept the implementation of ALPR and surveillance cameras for... God knows why.

The problem with this AI powered surveillance camera is that the tool can be misused by anyone in the police department and even unsuspecting hackers to apparently stalk women???

I leave it to you guys/girls to talk, this shit is dystopian to begin with.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1451116652316852296/1451116653386666194/IMG_20251218_073725.jpg?ex=6996be32&is=69956cb2&hm=c14450c0b17037ad7ad6bf51c523a9c07f3d790d539bc22dca806776ecd666c0&","👍 (1),😭 (1)"
