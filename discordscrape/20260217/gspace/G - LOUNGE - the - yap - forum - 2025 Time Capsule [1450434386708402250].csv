I don't know if this year has been the best year for you, it certainly hasn't been the kindest. But you know what you did, shibe? You overcame all of these challenges, you moved on. You fought all the shit that's going on, *and you still moved on*.

We're gonna do good in 2026. We're gonna do whatever it takes to be better. You've gotten strong throughout these years, and you know? You will be stronger!

*PS. I know that the gym is scary, but do exercise from time to time, would you?*","","❤️ (1)"

I am glad that after all of these chaos throughout the year, I finally can survive it all. To be alive is a gift, as I know not many other people are that fortunate as I am. All we can do now is to step forward and do better than before. 

2026 will/might be a year of chaos, though I still have hope for things to be better. Let's see what 2026 will brought us, and hopefully it can be something that we can cherish together in the future.","","❤️ (1)"

There were days I felt invisible, replaceable, and so tired that even resting felt like work. I smiled when I needed to, stayed quiet when it would’ve been easier to scream, and carried things I never asked to hold. Some nights I questioned myself, my worth, and whether I was falling behind everyone else. But I kept going anyway. Even when I didn’t feel strong, I endured—and that matters more than I ever gave myself credit for.

For the year ahead, I don’t wish for perfection. I wish for gentleness. I hope I learn to forgive myself for what I couldn’t do when I was doing my best just to exist. I hope I stop measuring my life against timelines that were never meant for me. I hope I learn to trust that slow growth is still growth, and that I am not late: I am becoming.

If future-me feels lost again, please remember this: you have already survived moments you once thought would break you. You are allowed to rest. You are allowed to change. You are allowed to take up space, even when you feel small.

Whatever music you’re listening to when you read this: remember how it once held you together when words couldn’t.

I hope you’re softer now. I hope you’re safer. And if you’re still healing, that’s okay. You were never meant to be done so quickly.

Take care of yourself.","","❤️ (2),🫂 (2)"

salary great work environment great everything is great, until the contract ends. No extension no good disposition in new project, its as if im just a pawn to be disposed.

I’ve accepted it, found a gf and i cherished every months even if jumping works and financially i am fucked in every possible ways, im still happy as i was in early months.

days are passed by with no worries, i feel like my suffering is worth the price, i feel that i can still sleep and wake up to see a glimpse of morning just to know that i have someone to be with, only then to reminded that i am just another choice and just a part of her, 

she was everything for me.
And i’m just a thing for her.

We broke up and it really hits me mentally still today, i have not yet recovered until now. I don’t know when but i don’t know if i will be able to.

Yet after all of that, i met a lot of great people in Discord, in this community G-Lounge & Mabased.

Lotso, Konco, Chrysal, Arsenz, Okin, Buzzer, Indah, Eden, Shibe, Adi, and several others in here that worth the mention for. I’m glad i met you guys.

Its been a really hella and fun ride, im able to atleast feel happy by talking to you guys, consulting, meeting up and others stuff we’ve done.

2025 still remains the shittiest year i’ve been. But atleast you guys helped me to feel its worth to be continued.


I learnt a lot, i lost a lot, and gain a lot.

All i can share to myself in the upcoming years, 

Love yourself and cherish even more those who are around you. Always stick with what matters to you.

Those suicidal matters don’t matters, a second chance of life always matters.

Love you guys, thank you and take care! ✨

I’ve been trying to understand everything and be grateful for what I have but guess what? I couldn’t so I pray to god for patience and peace but I just couldn’t tho . I hope 2026 will be better soon","","🫂 (3)"

I hope you've got more healthier and achieve more things in life, I know that this year has been tough, especially with alot of things going on, and discovering new things about me, so i do hope that, whilst I'm stuck in here for a while, you at least have gotten the ropes.

Remember what we said in our goals and how weve struck most of them? Lets go bigger, and become badder, remember to take some time off and be alone, if you ever have thoughts of it again, please visit someone now that you have the ability to do so!! Dont forget about your friends aswell, new and old!

And finally, i hope you've healed a wound that strucked you, love can wait okay? Love yourself first.

Side edit : hope you get 3 digit on osu! in 2026","",""

It was one of my motivations to what built me today.

I want to thank a friend named Jona, for helping me through all that, teaching me how to do business, how to make life easier and funner.

But because of that, I also became a robot, I was heartless, I didn't have a heart, I'll bankrupt any businesses if I could and necessary.

After all that, I met a lot of great people in Discord, G-Lounge and Mabased.

From there, I learnt that it's fine to have fun, I've got my heart back, warmed my cold profit-driven heart, all of you, Lotso, Buzzer, Konco, Indah, Arsenz, Lee, shibe, Adi, Jaxx, Jello, Kim, Lui, and many others.

You all made me realize it is okay to not use your friends, and have fun, it is okay to have a heart, you all melted my heart by showing me how Indonesia still has great and GOATed people.

It's been a really really fun adventure, at least I feel happy by conversing with y'all, meeting woth y'all.

2025 Zheng still has been the most workaholic work-driven profit-hungry Zheng. But at least, you all helped me recover my trust issues, and also made me realize it is worth to have fun once for a while.

I learnt a lot, I gained a lot, I yearned a lot (lol), I trolled a lot.

All I can share to myself for the upcoming years is,

Love and cherish everyone that's now in your life, you don't need to be a robot to reach the peak of your life.

Love you guys, Mabased and G Lounge, Thank You, Take Care!

Hopefully the next year will be a time everyone can make the right calls with the right mindset. I’m not just talking politics but IRL too. Keep it up g space 🙂","","❤️ (4)"

This year in 2025:
- You grew LB so much in just a year despite having to do it all on your own + mom, no FT/PT employees but shoutout to @muscat @kimmy and soon @cwk | angerypdd LB's freelance team who really I can't do this without you guys, and special shoutout to @PurwoZheng | angerymanagement for legal. Fingers crossed this really does become Indonesia's next biggest baddest brand, periodt 💅 REVOLUTIONIZING THE FUTURE OF NAILS, FIRST IN INDONESIA, AND THEN ASEAN, AND THEN, THE WORLDDDD
- You've definitely managed to solidify yourself as a somewhat-prominent name in the world of Indonesian politics, keep up the good work. You might go into office one day. Or don't, if it no longer sparks joy. Just be happy. Life is too short and too precious.
 - You really do have the bestest friends, some of the best people, around you, and in this very moment, you are so grateful. 
- You're doing bible studies with Jane and Sandy at Jane's house every Friday 4 PM. You're also reading both the New Testament and the Quran. You are still waiting for a sign from God, the ancestors, the universe, whatever, that there really is something bigger out there, if there is. 
- Money's a little tight at the moment and you haven't gotten your last 3 months worth of salary **from your own fucking company lol** but it's okay, you'll manage and pull through.
- You're currently *talking to/seeing that guy* ( 🇳🇱) LOL, girl you is MAD DEEP in lover girl mode right now, went from boss bitch iron lady to virgin maiden all because of this man... 

However far out into the future you will be by the time you revisit this:
- Honestly just keep sticking to what you're already doing for LB and TIGS/politics.
- Be happy
- Please figure out work-life balance ffs.
- Save up more money 
- I hope we're still friends with all the same people, and make even more friends in the future 
- Travel more
- I hope he's still there (I really hope he ends up being the one)","","❤️ (14),👍 (1)"

Some sadness, some happiness.
Some goals achieved, some missed.

Financially, there was real progress. I managed to reach RP 100 million per month, and that matters. I aimed higher—RP 250 million—and failed to break it this year. Still, the attempt counts. Hopefully next year will be better, stronger, and more consistent.

On a personal level, I’m still figuring myself out. I hope that by 2026, I’ll have a real relationship. Part of what holds me back is shyness. Sometimes I see beautiful girls as almost goddesses—so distant that trying feels impossible. It’s not even fear of rejection, more a feeling of not belonging in the same space.

If future me is reading this, remember:

Progress isn’t linear.

Missing a target doesn’t erase how far you came.

Shyness was never a flaw, just a starting point.

People are human before they are beautiful.

You didn’t need to be fearless to move forward—just willing to try.

I hope you learned to take small steps anyway. Awkward ones. Honest ones.
And I hope you’re kinder to yourself now than you were then.

Here’s to patience, growth, and a better version of tomorrow.
