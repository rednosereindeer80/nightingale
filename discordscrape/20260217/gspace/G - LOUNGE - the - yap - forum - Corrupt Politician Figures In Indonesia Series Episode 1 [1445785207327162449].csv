The aim of this series is not only to exposed politician figures with their cases, but to go as far as to analyze their damages, scope and even their influence inside their positions, while covering their current status after the case. The series will not discuss the most obvious ones in the list first, but will go from smaller figures and less known ones to uncover before finally going for the biggest or commonly known figures in the list for the final deserts. There are a few things to be pointed out before continuing the tier list:
-    Most of the politician figures here originated from the Reformation Era (mainly 2000’s to 2020’s period) with a few exceptions for those that are still alive until this day. 
-    These figures include positions from DPRD, DPR, DPD, MPR, Mayor/Regent, Governor, Ministers, and even the Presidents. 
-    Documents that covered about these figures will be seen in order to further add extra materials to observe. This include KPK documents, news articles, etc.
-    The analysis of these figures mainly lacks in gathering the primary sources from the field, as it is heavily dependent on secondary sources gathered from digital footprints or sources. Some weak oversight on their cases can happen so take it with a grain of salt as the data about these figures can also be hidden from the general publics. 
-    The figures that are listed here had been officially declared guilty and punished for their crimes, with them either had served their time in prisons or set free to do their own business.","","jax (1),👍 (1),Indahbweh (1)"

Born in Parepare Town, he was the first of the six siblings with his father being a nobility by bloodline, King Bantaeng XXVII. He came from a good educative background as he became the very first regent in Indonesian history to bear a title as a professor (he even went to study in Japan to get his PhD degree in agriculture). A long-time player in politics, he became the Regent of Bantaeng from 2008 to 2018. This intellectual background, combined with his reputation as someone who has a nobility title, perhaps contributed to his public career as a politician. Previously in 2015, he received an award as “Tokoh Perubahan” from Republika along with 3 other officials and Bung Hatta Anti-Corruption Award in 2017, along with many awards that had been gifted to him (100 awards from multiple sectors). By 2018, he went for the governorship race which he won with more than 1.8 million of votes, the biggest vote against 3 other competitors in the race. However, a KPK investigation happened in 2021 during his governorship which ended the career of such intellectual figure for good. The case involved a gratification and bribery case, in which he was imprisoned for 5 years until his release by 18th August, 2023. Many medias covered the irony of his previous political stance of being an anti-gratification advocate along with his anti-corruption award before the capture.


Total Wealth: Rp 51.3 billion (2021 during his arrest), which include his wealth and assets that he tried to hide away.","","👍 (3)"

He received a 5-year prison sentence, a fine amounted to Rp 500 million (or 4 months additional jail) while receiving an order to repay Rp. 2.187 billion plus SGD 350,000 to the state.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1445785207327162449/1445785663294275694/image.png?ex=69967713&is=69952593&hm=711ae399db060685a2c555f15d43aec1e3dd2d876b33679634ee94ca7df28e2b&",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-03T14:36:21.4410000+00:00","Timeline:
-    In 2021, KPK conducted a raid operation which caught Nurdin along with Agung Sucipto and aide Edy Rahmat at his official residence.
-    By July to November 2021, he was charged with joint bribery and gratifications. The prosecutors sought 6 years but the court gave the final decision for 5 years in prison time.
-    By 2023, he was released from his service in prison earlier in August, 2023 after receiving a prison reduction time. He then joined Perindo Party for 2 years before in 2025, he left the party officially without specific report behind the motive.
Corruption Methods:
-    Accepting bribes in return for favoring contractors in provincial projects, including the Palampag-Munte Bontolempangan road tenders in the amount of Rp. 2.5 billion and SGD 150,000 from Agung Sucipto (PT Agung Perdana/Cahaya Sepang).
-    Gratuities totaling Rp. 13 billion from multiple contractors via aide Syamsul Bahri from FerryTanriadi, H Momo and Hj Indar via procurement chief Sari Pudjiastuti.","","👍 (2)"

"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-03T14:37:06.2760000+00:00","Networks:
-    Direct accomplices include contractors Agung Sucipto, Ferry Tanriadi, Nurwai bin Pakki (H Momo), and Hj Indar. Then aides Edy Rahmat, Syamsul Bahri and finally procurement official Sari Pudjiastuti.
-    Enablers of the case linked to goods/services procurement in South Sulawesi provincial government, making five other figures arrested in the initial raid. He was also linked with four companies during the case, primarily the Japanese-linked ventures he founded or directed (PT Maruki International for example).
-    His family still run inside the world of politics, including his wife and the eldest son. His wife, Liestiaty Fachrudin tried to run as a Golkar candidate for the DPR role during the election in 2024 with an unsuccessful result. However, his eldest son Muhammad Fathul Fauzy Nurdin Abdullah managed to win inside the regency competition, gaining the position as Bantaeng Regent due to his father’s influence, a family dynasty. There are speculations that his son played a role in arranging and managing aspects of funds, drawing assumptions if the corruption involvement spread way beyond just Nurdin Abdullah himself. 
Impact:
The case caused a whole breakout of controversies with various medias noted how Nurhadi was a strong advocate of anti-gratification and corruption figure. It erodes public trust in the governance of South Sulawesi with rigged infrastructure procurement, undermining fair bidding in roads and public works. Furthermore, the case emphasized the pattern of regional graft prior to the post-decentralization era while highlighting vulnerabilities in procurement.","","👍 (2)"

-    A claim from WALHI Sulsel urged the investigation regarding his past regency period that involved business monopolies before his governorship period. An informal nickname brewed during his regency and governorship as “Juragan Tanah” (Land Baron) due to his business influence. 
-    A political conflict brewed in 2019 in which Nurdin clashed with his own Vice Governor Sudirman Sulaiman. The conflict resulted with unauthorized reassignment of 200 officials, leading to a tension between the two sides. Eventually order was restored as the reassignment was cancelled, but it highlighted the tension between the two sides during their time as governor and vice-governor before Nurdin’s downfall. 
-    There was an allegation that Nurdin also conducted corruption, specifically regarding sand mining in Kodingareng island by PT BLI and PT NIT companies. Local fishermen protested against these businesses but got quickly apprehended by the local authorities. However, this allegation was never seen to progress, as the case went stalled after his punishments in 2021.","",""
