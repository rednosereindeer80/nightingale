Geopolitics is basically a group project gone feral. Countries pulling on each other’s wigs, alliances breaking up like messy situationships, and diplomacy is just “ghosting”

**2. Climate change said “gorl, I’m speeding up btw.”**
Heatwaves where there shouldn’t be heatwaves, floods where there shouldn’t be floods, and half the world arguing over whether it’s real while the other half is sweating like it's a free sauna.

**3. The economy is playing Twister with inflation.**
Prices go up, salary stays doing the mannequin challenge. Housing is expensive, groceries are expensive

**4. Social media turned human brains into microwaved spaghetti.**
Everyone’s angry, tired, doomscrolling, or arguing with strangers named “xXGuRlYPoP69Xx.” Attention spans? Gone. Critical thinking? MIA.

**5. Misinformation is basically a pandemic with no vaccine.**
Facts? Optional. Conspiracies? Buy one get one free. People choosing vibes over verified sources like it's a personality trait.

**6. Mental health is CANCELLED.**
Everyone’s overwhelmed, under-rested, and trying to survive life with the emotional stability of a lego tower missing most its blocks.

**7. Technology is running faster than human ethics.**
AI getting smart, people getting confused, governments getting scared

**8. Inequality is absolutely doing the most.**
Rich getting richer, poor getting poorer, middle class playing hide and seek but no one finds them.

**9. Youth unemployment + job market chaos.**
Companies want 8 years experience for an entry-level job that pays in “exposure.” gurl, we’re catching up from YEARS of missed industrialization.

**10. People kinda forgot how to be decent to each other.**
Patience? Low. Empathy? Buffering. Opinions? Loud. Common sense? QUESTIONABLE.","","👍 (2)"
