Okok, so there are a few things that I can find here. Bahlil himself admitted that he is going to give Muhammadiyah its own mining place. A few questioned what Muhammadiyah can do or are they competent enough to be able to do the mining management.

Now right after that, there were less news that updated about Muhammadiyah and the mining thingy. But there is one very interesting source that stated that Muhammadiyah until this day, haven't received the mining place yet.

This means that Muhammadiyah may have received news that they will receive the mines: only for Bahlil to go back into his words as it was quoted from CNBC:

""Bahlil mengatakan tim Kementerian ESDM awalnya telah mendorong Muhammadiyah untuk bisa mengelola wilayah tambang eks Adaro. Namun demikian, setelah dilakukan kajian lokasi tersebut dinilai masih memerlukan pendalaman data.""","","‼️ (1)"
