The way that some people still depicted our warriors or armies during late medieval to 18th century for only using bows, spears and other traditional weapons were false. Many kingdoms for instances in Nusantara, had been recorded to even use firearms as early as 15th to 16th century. Mainly this was due to the spread of gunpowder through the Mongolian invasion in Java. Later on, handcannons and even smaller calibre of cannons were made by Majapahit as they were using it for their fleets, like for example: Cetbang.","",""

As a matter of fact, some would began to copy the Portuguese designs for matchlocks. Malacca for example, had already stored firearms by importing it from Java and Gujarati, but the defeat by the Portuguese pushed forward for the development of firearms, eventually giving birth to a copy design known as Istinggar during Johor period.","",""
