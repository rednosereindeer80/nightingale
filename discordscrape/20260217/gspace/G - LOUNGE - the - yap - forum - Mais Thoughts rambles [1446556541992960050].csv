Lets define and give some context and background before i dive into this topic, some of you may agree, others may disagree, that is fine, me personally? As much as i dislike it, id figure it be better to explain why AI is viewed as a bad thing in the Creative Industry world, and more specifically, Artists","",""

I pretty much do what art students do, except i'm not one, but i can vouch for my skills and I do have results i can share, but this whole segment is to introduce of what kind of person i am that allowed me to be able to vouch the art industry as a whole as to why we (and yes, _we_) dislike the use of AI","",""

Creation is the process in which that it deliberately combines previous ideas into an original construct, or original ideas that creates an original construct, it is form by the human mind, no two constructs are the same, they can be similar, but they are not the same.

It also appeals towards one person only, as even if it was exposed to other people, it originates from itself, for itself, by itself","",""

What it also created is standardization, in which that everyone gets the equal amount, because you cannot assume the same person would have the same specific appeal, but it does have a threshold of what is ""acceptable"" by the majority","",""

The ""downside"", but moreso it that it happens like everything else, is that the process of creating it is very difficult, time consuming, and overall material and muscle coordination memory that is what stops and demotivates alot of people into stepping into art","",""
