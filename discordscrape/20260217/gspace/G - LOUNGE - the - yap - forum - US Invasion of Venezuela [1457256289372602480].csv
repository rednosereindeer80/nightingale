Although Maduro's capture is an understandable relief to those who suffered under his dictatorship, it does not justify the methods used by the United States. Acting without international authorization and bombing nations under the pretext of combating terrorism, drugs, trafficking, justifying all this under the guise of Maduro’s election being rigged—sets an incredibly dangerous precedent where sovereignty CAN be disregarded by bigger more powerful nations, and innocent people pay the price. 

~40 Venezuelan military personnel and civilians were killed.

This only confirms what many have always known: behind the feigned discourse surrounding ""democracy"" and ""freedom,"" the real interest of the US has consistently been control over natural resources as means to generate profit-especially oil.

Regardless of whether one supports or opposes Maduro, the sovereignty of a nation should never be violated or 'managed' by another power for economic gain.

We are living in dangerous times.

History has shown, time and again, how intervention-especially US intervention-framed as ""help"" in the end always turn into exploitation.

If a single power is allowed to intervene in any country at will, then we are left to wonder how long will it take until it is our turn to become ""the next Venezuela?""","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1457256289372602480/1457256289674465387/C2396AE5-D8EA-4719-B9FB-E6BD00A87B73.jpg?ex=6996aaad&is=6995592d&hm=eafd45a235f4b22a6990377c4735a335f511385b3e3ec3f5ccab3fbfb3f9c008&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1457256289372602480/1457256290156941372/079A9E8C-49C6-4818-8B2F-AAB036DEBD7D.jpg?ex=6996aaae&is=6995592e&hm=97071eaa2b3cb17dc59161451e63c8137506245e54e4453c7053f6398dfd56bb&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1457256289372602480/1457256290450538526/0C92C759-9F64-435E-BF0C-0495E194BCF7.jpg?ex=6996aaae&is=6995592e&hm=eaa5b614d936e217e73c94ca696b678b998db0fd9b160fbd31a818a9a2bb2296&","👍 (2)"
