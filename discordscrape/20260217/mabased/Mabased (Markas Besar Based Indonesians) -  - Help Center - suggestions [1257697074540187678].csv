- Jakarta is Hot, are there any ways or goals to cool out jakarta with some innovations ?
Reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKbEOMCsqaI&t=183s
- Jakarta takes a ton of power to run, while i know theres a ton of innovation for renewable energy, mostly in indo we still use coal, oil and biofuels. now i know we currently have 3 nuclear plants but their all not commercial (yet), is there any plans to use Nuclear energy to help in Jakartas heavy electricity intake, while it is just a PLTU with extra steps, well a lot of extra steps and hot rocks, ik theres some dangers and it cost a lot to operate, so how about putting more wind turbines and more solar power for starters instead of making stupid statues like one of our last governor.
- as we know, jakarta is sinking. i kinda wanna live here so can you prevent that more ? while i know theres some projects for stopping the sinking, its kinda not working right now.
- oh y can we have a race tracks around jakarta so theres less illegal races ?
thats all i guess, im not politically literate and im ESL so im sr if theres any stupid question and wrong words","",""

In light of the current debaucle that is our (once) beloved country Indonesia, I was thinking about an Indonesian rendering of Les Miserables' ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"". I find the title to be very apt considering the deafness of our politicians, their cronies, and the law-enforcement force (both brown and green). And it is a very popular protest song. They used it in Hong Kong, , The Philippines, and most recently in South Korea when their president did an oopsie and the whole country got mad. So an Indonesian version would seem very fitting in this climate

Now while I do have *some* background in music, I am pretty limited in other forms of capabilities. So here I am thinking if there are any people in this server is, or know someone who might be fitting, maybe a background in music production, composing, choir, instruments and the creative side like video production and post-production, I am up for some talks and discussion because I feel like this could be a rallying cry to possibly unite the people.

A big ask, I know, and even I still dont have any concrete idea of how it'll work and the logistics and stuff. But I hope this could light the idea, a spark or impetus dare I say, of us as a nation achieving something grander. If, pardon, some tiktok dance and brainrot song can convince nearly 58% of the population to do something a certain way, then why not try this one, or at least give it a thought and entertain the idea for a bit

Sorry for long post. Cheers","",""

As my perspective, #⊱・📝・the-yap-forum  isnt just 'mini conversation' but also a **Library**. 

People start new forum of discussion, and put their mind on it. In the future, when the similar topic were called on #⊱・🗺️・international-discussion , u can refer em to related forum so they could read full conversation related to it. This action alr implemented few times on real conversation in this server before.

The idea about makin Yap-Forum into 'Library' is already genious, one of the best way to store conversation that are easily to track down, just like these main topic :

- one of members def started it, but then doubled down and put the blame on stonky for starting it when it was buzzer who first started the ping
- stonky could benefit frrom being less aggressive and being more level headed but im sure she knows already
- also because stonky is the most active mod + most chaotic, she gets flack for things she does not do, in this case what Buzzer did. instead her flack is from how she reacted
- whole thing is a non issue, as blangonga said
- its wrong to say the server is more about politics than hanging out, it may be the intention of why people come here but its not necessarily how you maintain a community if its always just about discussing politics seriously

2. It seems that these channels have been used properly and effectively, nevertheless the #⊱・👐・”paham”-thread  seems just a waste of channels tbh and I think we dont actually need the #⊱・👋・introduction , even though it's nice to introduce yourself to the server and knowing more about someone so you don't offend a fella. As for the #⊱・📰・global-news , it's useful but no discussions about it.

In conclusion:
I suggest that we should remove the #⊱・👐・”paham”-thread and the #⊱・👋・introduction . If you actually don't need it, up to the mods tbh.

And for the #⊱・📰・global-news , make it's own section, may I give some suggestion for the look of the news and a few branch for it.

1. Geopolitical News
Only news about the geopolitical circumstances nationally and internationally.
Example of news:
https://news.detik.com/internasional/d-7956326/ulah-israel-cegat-kapal-bantuan-untuk-gaza-yang-bawa-thunberg-dan-11-aktivis

2. Economy and Trade News
Only filled with news that are connected to the world/national market, trade, and economical situation right now.
Example of news:
https://www.rri.co.id/daerah/1571945/harga-cabai-masih-tinggi-pasca-idul-adha

3. Unimportant/Entertainment News:
Only news about the world of art, entertainment, culture, and etc.
Example of news:
https://www.idntimes.com/korea/kdrama/drama-korea-tentang-detektif-kepolisian-q9t02-00-v8jyb-mf1zj6

4. News Discussion
Where members of the server discuss only about the news topic they bring. And we can only discuss one news at a time, until a discussion of a news is over, a next one may proceed. And to know if a discussion is over or not, if no one continues a discussion for 20 minutes, a new news discussion may commence. This is to prevent confusion in the discussion","",""
