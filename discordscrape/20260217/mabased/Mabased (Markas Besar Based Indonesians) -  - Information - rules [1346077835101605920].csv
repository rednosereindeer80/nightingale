1.    Low level infractions,
This will occur in a member’s first offence. The nature of this infraction is via “verbal warning” by the moderation team to remind members not to break the rules, such as: 
•    Speaking in the wrong channel;
•    Spamming;
•    Sending suggestive content;
•    Taking things out of context (misquoting, etc)
•    Offensive discord profile (name, avatar, bio, etc)
•    Public meltdowns;
•    Mini-modding or backseat moderating;
•    Misleading information or hoax;
•    Sharing own or others personal information [TMI behaviour (if you want to share more personal information, do it in DMs)].
> 1.    phone number
> 2.    identification number
> 3.    location address
> 4.    personal emails
> 5.    bank accounts
> 6.    etc
Continuous repetition of rule breaking on low level infraction, will result as a first official warning in the form of @X1 role and a 1-day timeout. Continued effort would be met with 1 week timeout and the @X2 and/or @X3 role.

2.    Mid-level infractions,
Continuous act of breaking server rules will result in an **IMMEDIATE** first official warning in the form of @X1, which will be appropriately followed by @X2 and/or @X3. However, there are special cases where members will immediately receive @X2 and @X3 depending on the severity of the offense. Here are the categories listed below: 

•    @X1 and 1-day timeout
o    Curse word baiting;
o    Excessive trolling and provocations;
o    Harassment (pick-me behaviour and/or flirting without consent).
•    @X2 and 1 week timeout
o    Death jokes;
o    Sexist/bigoted behaviours;
o    Homophobia.
•    @X3 and 1 month timeout
o    Self-harm (suicidal ideation);
o    Hate speech (giving ideas about committing crimes, bullying, etc);
o    Sharing of classified documents (only buzzer can share classified documents);
o    Blackmailing;
o    Clout Chasing.


3.    High level infractions
This is the highest level of infractions that a member or moderators can commit. If **YOU** continue to break the rules after being mediated by the moderators and/or with buzzer, we will have no choice but to take drastic action. But other than continuous rule breaking, there are also server infractions that will result in immediate **BAN**. These are the said infractions: 
•    Inappropriate content (pornography, gore, violence);
•    Racist remarks and derogatory remarks (n-word, f-word, etc);
•    Impersonation of Buzzer, his staffs, and his circle (personal and/or professional);
•    Death threats;
•    Sexual harassment;
•    Illegal promotion (illegal gambling site, parlays, online loans, crypto, selling drugs and weapons, etc).
