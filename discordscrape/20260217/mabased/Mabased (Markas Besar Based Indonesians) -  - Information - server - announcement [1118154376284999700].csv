It has come to my attention that certain individuals have been expressing sexist and racist thoughts and statements within this server. I do not tolerate these two outside of the realm of humor which we of the admins will decide.

I recognize that opening up a server where we talk about political issues from a social to historical perspective might invite these sorts of prejudice and clientele but I want to make sure we all have good and silly vibes inside the server instead of a negative one.

Thank you very much.

Since the beginning of the elections on 2023, I've been prioritizing work over my own mental health and personal relationship. Throughout the year I've lost the people who were important to me and many of my personal relationships were changed as my work continue to change me into a different person. I think you'd understand that feeling of losing people you value over what you think is important to your life's work. And all of that affair has hit me like a bullet train by the end of the elections. I now face the consequences of prioritizing work over my life.

And it has been a really bad impact towards my well being as well as the people around me. I want to focus on myself and the people around me more, and actually build meaningful relationships moving forward. 

Besides that, The Based Indonesian Show is facing changes to its programming and production. We are expected to receive newer additions to the team and better visuals as well as a (finally) well thought out plan of what we want to do in the future. Two new co-host will be introduced to help the Based Indonesian Show, and big names are being contacted in order to appear up in the Based Indonesian Show.

Considering those two factors, the Based Indonesian Show will now slow down in terms of content. I think I will just post one content per week, and shorts depending on the availability of the content. ***I will stream depending on the mood and time, in which I will announce atleast 12 hours before the stream***. Bear in mind that all of these are an attempt to improve the quality of our content. 

But because the Based Indonesian Show is all about its viewers, we want you to tell us what you want! **Tag me and the @Dewan Pengurus to submit the changes you want to see in the Based Indonesian Show!**

Thank you for following our small and humble Based Indonesian Show 🙏","","👏 (3),🤝🏻 (1),🤗 (2)"

Surely this will signal an America more involved with inward problems and will definitely redefine once again America's relationship with Indonesia into something more uncertain but definitely more transactional. A stronger and happy America is what we need but RIP to Ukraine and Palestine. RIP to Taiwan. I think this is for the best, but appeasement is never the option (as we learn so from history) so we expect Trump to have an even stronger but fairer foreign policy against Russia and China.

@everyone 
Just a quick reminder to respect each other’s boundaries when chatting here. Everyone has different comfort levels, and it’s important to be mindful of that.

✅ Be kind and considerate – Think before you speak and make sure your words don’t make others uncomfortable.
✅ If someone asks you to stop, stop – No means no, whether it’s jokes, personal questions, or certain topics.
✅ Keep things civil – Disagreements happen, but there’s no excuse for harassment, bullying, or pushing someone’s limits.

If you ever feel uncomfortable or notice someone crossing the line, don’t hesitate to reach out to a mod. Let’s keep this space safe and welcoming for everyone.

@everyone 

Hey guys, hope you’re well. I’m here to remind all members about **Civilian Reporting** and how it is important for our community. 

There are times when members get immediately reprimanded by moderators and there are times where bad things happen here and no moderators are not present, which would be bad (though we keep a vigilant supervision most of the time). **But the absence of moderators ≠ you taking over mod duties**. If anything happens, tag us and mention us in the incident ASAP.

or for instance, you need to build a case or evidence gathering?

We highly opt you to use the #⊱・📩・support-ticket so you can file a formal report, rather than dm-ing one mod or more. Don’t forget to tag us in the ticket as well.

We highly appreciate your collaboration, MABASED.

📢 **Server Conduct Reminder: Respectful Debating & Discussing** 🧠

When engaging in debates or discussions, especially those involving strong opinions or complex topics, it's important to stay respectful and focused on the argument—not the person. A well-structured conversation benefits everyone, but when someone feels challenged, they may respond emotionally.

🔴 **Examples of what NOT to do during a debate:**
- Resorting to **ad hominem** (attacking the person instead of their argument)  
- Using **sarcasm** or **mocking** others  
- **Interrupting**, **talking over**, or spamming messages to drown out others  
- Making **sweeping generalizations** or labeling people unfairly  
- Responding with **hostility**, **passive-aggression**, or **dismissive emojis**  
- **Derailing** the topic or moving the goalposts to avoid answering directly  
- Accusing others of being “emotional” or “irrational” as a rebuttal tactic

✅ **What to do instead:**
- Focus on ideas, not individuals  
- Stay calm and listen actively  
- Ask for clarification before assuming intentions  
- Back your claims with logic, evidence, or examples  
- Agree to disagree respectfully if no consensus is reached

Let’s keep discussions healthy and insightful. Everyone’s voice matters—but how we use that voice matters even more.","","🇦🇺 (1),🫡 (9),__ (4)"

1. If you have never interacted with me please come with a specific question because best results happen when I know you long enough on discord
2. Please refrain from discussing while cards are being shuffled and drawn (You can yap after results are sent) The last time that happened concentration, energy, and focus broke down leading into less than accurate results. I will personally mute people who yap too much :).

See you  🪄

PS. If time is friendly I will stream a concert recording, currently deciding between Linkin Park or twenty one pilots
PSS. The next reading will be in July/August.","","👍 (5)"

Dear, MABASED @Kader 

Today marks the birth of Indonesia’s state ideology—not just a ceremonial slogan, but a foundational framework that can balance idealism with realpolitik if you actually engage with it.

Pancasila isn’t about maintaining the status quo. In fact, it can be a shield against both radicalism and authoritarianism. 

Since Buzzer’s Ideology is about believing in the Pancasila, you should see it not as some dusty recital piece, but as an ideological battlefield you can push from the left, right, or center—just don’t be dumb about it.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1118154376284999700/1378585316365041674/IMG_0656.jpg?ex=6995e360&is=699491e0&hm=82940e0b9eb31259c5e43e04f0e4b472b3bc92415d36357dec0b3b0bf2d5fc58&","🔥 (18),Indonesia (19),pray (7),RIP (1),whug (2)"

@everyone 
I understand some of you guys here have things you wanna talk about. Especially after being noticed by the mod team, it’s venting that has become more prevalent here. Especially something that has very strong links to subjects that most people couldn’t help with in any capacity, e.g. mental health issues, finances and etc.

So here’s a reminder for you guys:

# Be considerate of what you guys bring to the public space.

A simple mishandling of your “situation” could cause **dire consequences** for the reader. People might get triggered if the conversation is not handled properly. Or worse, any shared information is at risk of being manipulated and that could cause trouble even to the extent of sending the wrong message about the mabased community.

So we the mod team urge you to please **be careful, be civil & be considerate** of what you speak here. We intend the server to be a safe space, as we are doing our best.

We sincerely hope you understand.

Ps. *if there are any inputs or complaints against this PSA, do let us know via #⊱・📩・support-ticket  and we will address your concerns promptly*

@Kader 

There's a difference between venting/sharing your struggles and oversharing in chat!

Please be mindful of your fellow members when you share personal stories. You will be warned if the conversation becomes inappropriare and brings discomfort to fellow members aka bad vibes

Here's a tip, ask yourself these whenever you share things about yourself:

1. Have you interacted with people currently online frequently enough for them to recieve your story well?
Yes? Good keep going
No? Hold it off or DM them

2. Is the thing you're sharing heavy to digest? Is it depressing? Is it sensitive? Is it inappropriate? Will it make people uncomfortable to read and awkward to respond to?
Yes? Take it elsewhere
No? Sure but in moderation pls

3. If minors are presently online, is this something that would be beneficial for them to hear as a lesson in life?
Yes? Sure but mind your language
No? Take it elsewhere

4. Is this NSFW or will lead to NSFW conversation?
Yes? You are breaking the rules

Hello Kaders!

This server has grown quite rapidly since we started the mod team - it's only been *five months*, could you believe it?

That being said, Server Administrators have decided to open a second round of moderator recruitment, and we hope that potential moderators have the following qualities:

- can commit to active interaction in the server
- has an understanding of mabased server dynamics and operations
- able to host an event / yap in  voice channels, occassionally
- able to handle fights in chat, both casual and political discussions
- respect confidentiality, particularly personal details of members, content creation, and state secrets
- good health and of sound body and mind

If you are interested, please fill out the form by **5 September**. Candidates will be screened on several factors, including **age, chat history, and professionalism**. Following that we will reach out to potential moderators to confirm their interest

Alternatively, you can nominate other people too! Send us your nominations by opening a ticket

Good luck!

We’ve cleaned up the server. These are the chats that no longer exists:

- **chiller chat**
- **rage bait**
- **commie chat & the VC**
- **faschat and the VC**
- **ideology**

We believe that there were issues with the channels and we’ve agreed that it’s redudant and therefore decided it’s better to keep it as one with #⊱・🗺️・international-discussion . Now i understand that there will be worries of the channel being ridden of one sided topics. 

However, there’s a reason why #⊱・📝・the-yap-forum exists and also the ability to request through #⊱・📩・support-ticket to make your own sub-thread if you feel the need to have a more specified discussion and still be seen by other members. **Just open up a ticket and request to have the thread open under the discussion channel**.

There are also updates on the VC names of the server. We’ve realized that the “Gaming 2” voice chat has become somewhat of a cult classic for the members. Therefore, we’re renaming it into **THE BACKROOM** as it is well suited to the nature of the chats and hopefully members will remain civil there and still adhere to the #⊱・📜・rules 

That is all from me and the mods. Feel free to ping us in the chats if there are any further complaints in #⊱・💡・suggestions . Thank you and have a good day.

Whatsapp message broadcasts urging all chinese indonesians to stay inside, now widely forwarded

Kidnappings of two university students in chindo majority universities in Tangerang Selatan, university and time of incident never specified

And various reports of verbal harrasment on the streets of Jakarta

All of this happened in one day, gradually and slowly

We alongside fellow discord members who were monitoring the situation all day have tried to investigate these sources but they are either taken down, suspiciously similar to other sources, or cannot be found

The difficulty with this is that official news media has been ordered to refrain from reporting anything about the events of this week and many such reports have been spreading via word of mouth and social media and thus needed to be investigated via social media as well..

If you see any of these please take extreme precautions and verify them yourself before forwarding them.

Guys yg punya Saudara atau kawan daerahh **Glodok** harap berhati-hati.
Ada wacana besok akan ada __Penjarahan di daerah Glodok__, kabarin kerabat yg disana. Klo bsa evakuasi dlu. Pergi ninggalin daerah sana.

Rekan-rekan Ojol dilapangan Masih banyak yang dilokasi kerusuhan, kalo Grup gue rata² ada di  pasar senen. Sudah ada broadcast untuk mundur dari grub sejabodetabek, tapi ada omongan soal menjarah glodok juga besok. Jadi masa ojol kemungkinan sudah terbagi dan susah dikendalikan. Intinya sampai subuh ini mereka Masih ada di TKP (Jakarta)

Untuk temen-temen sebaliknya ngungsi dlu.
Khususnya yg (maaf) Ras Chinese, karena sasaran mereka adalah yang berwajah Chinese.

Maaf mengganggu kalian,
Cuma mau kasih info.
Info penting untuk menentukan situasi & langkah berikutnya supaya bisa terhindar dari bahaya.
Stay safe everyone 🫡
May God be with you all.

Mod team would like to salute all of you for your efforts in monitoring the situation and being conscious of the developing situation

That being said Eden would like to add that the above announcement may not be true and would like to apologise for this mistake - let us chalk it as the worst example of a fearmongering hoax.

However because the location and time is of sensitive nature it would not be wise to not share this either

Today has been a long day, too many things are happening and Mod team are trying their best to make sure everyone goes through this calmly - it's our first time too!

Please take a break when you can, don't spend too many hours on discord. Just because we have compiled the information and filtered out the hoaxes still means that it is still a form of doomscrolling.

For the members who contribute to helping us moderate the chat, calling out other members for typing in the wrong chat, and sending information and links, we thank you alot

For the courageous members who went down on the field today, the server thanks you for your bravery and showing us the reality of the streets to counter the feamongering on social media

@Kader 
Hey, It’s Konco

I understand the situation in our country right now is not at the best moment. We have tried our best in filtering all information the best as we can, and I also understand that we still have that feeling of unrest given the newest updates.

Yes some information might be true or false, and some of us has been trying to filter the information as best as we can. **But going against one another, pointing fingers at people will not solve our problems right now.** This is what “our enemies” want. To divide and create panic as to disturb the movement for national justice, **__please do not let it divide this people’s server__**. 

I urge us to be more vigilant with a cool, calm and collected manner as best as we can be. We are the people of MABASED. You guys joined this server for a reason and that is not to divide one another, but to learn and respect each of our differing opinions and views. This is going to be one of the toughest time our server is gonna go through. Stand united and not be divided by misinformation, stay true to our knowledge and not let false pretences get the better of your judgement. 

**Stay BASED.** 

Together we’re gonna go through this crisis, together we’re going to keep calm and push on until we get to the truth and not let lies affect your judgement.

We got this guys, we’ll pull through.

Stay safe, Stay based MABASED.

Now that I got your attention, **MABASED IS TRYING TO GET MORE MEMBERS IN**. We already have a lot of members and kaders in this server, and you guys rock 🤘🏻 give yourself a pat in the back.

However I do believe that this server could use some more… *bump*or promotion. Hence why as an update, **MABASED is currently in the DISBOARD promotion page**. The server’s put there in the hopes to spread the good name of Basedless Indo, and maybe to get more friends from abroad and tell them that **anjing lu** means ***I respect you***.

But that’s just the beginning, we also have @Yggdrasil bot now that you can play with in #⊱・🎲・bot-games with its commands and shit. 

Hopefully you guys are staying tuned to the server’s development, and please let us know in #⊱・💡・suggestions or make a ticket in #⊱・📩・support-ticket if you have any other ideas that can help the server grow.

-Since the August protests I've been wrought with disappointment and I was disillusioned by the politics. This became an obstacle to my creative process and I threw myself mostly in work around September which is why I barely posted anything.
-Since going to Korea in August, I have been experiencing coughs and wheezing. Around October 14th, after spending the entire day outside to attend my friend's birthday party, I woke up the next day with a high fever. I drank some meds hoping that the symptoms would go away but the symptoms worsened and I spent 5 days in a feverish condition, a terrible fever and headache I can barely get any sleep. I stubbornly refused to go to the doctors thinking it was flu and continued my work, and day by day it went away but I had a terrible cough and flu. Suddenly it was getting really hard for me to breath and I was weak most of the time. The doctors said I had chronic bronchitis and that the airways on my right lung is filled with mucus and was inflammed, making breathing hard and cardio related activities difficult.
-Around two weeks ago, a member of my family got typhus and I had to stay and look after them in the hospital for a week, baring me from any work or content related matters.
-It's hard for me to stream or produce content at night because I'm focusing on trying to apply for master's degree. And the process is tedious. I was working on my GRE, my IELTS, my WES, and 11 university application simultaneously between the periods of September till now.

That's why I haven't dropped a video for a while but I really wanted to talk about the SMA 72 case which I think deserves more attention since it has something to do with the direction of our youth and education. Around mid December, I think I will be more freer to do more content and hopefully we can get that offline meetup I promised you guys.

we have just banned Stonky in both G space, Mabased, and WIUI. If you have not noticed, she has been a very prominent contributor to the chats in the server but however lately we have seen one too many instances of her fighting the chat, bullying her, and influencing the big chat to ostracise and isolate the member. On this oversight, we apologise for waiting so long to take action

last month, the moderation team was approached with a random account, who has dmed us with messages from our personal mod chat
the account insinuates that they have hacked our server, read through our messages, and sent it to us as blackmail, intending to make mods suspect and hate each other

we have banned this member from wiui and mabased - since i am moderating both

we spent most of the last month investigating in a private group chat who this person might be

following that, in response to recent fights stonky has had with members, she was requested to lay off, cool down, and improve her behavior. however this was not followed, and therefore server owners have decided to not only talk her down, but ban her. this explains the weird baby gif out of nowhere

using an alt account that she had used in wiui under another name
stonky, after being fired - she was fired, by the way, because she banned a member without due process and consensus - and a week later somehow hacked the server to read messages that were sent after her firing, and that was part of the blackmail that we recieved

mods have approached certain members who have fought with stonky to garner information. in the process, the realisation of the alt's identity came when tracking down chat logs from stonk's known alias in wiui only to see that it was indeed the name of the hacker

I’ve noticed that there has been a lot of current issues that concerns a lot of us here and it may have caused a lot of stress. Updating the news here is a part of this server’s purpose to let the community speak their take on the situation.

However, 

It is understandable that some might see it as a stress inducing conundrum. Some might choose not to read, some might even chose to rant their frustration out on the current takes, and that’s alright.

So, as a friendly nudge to us, if the news here or the discussions here are too stressing, I urge us to focus on the things we can control. Because the news isn’t going to change just because we want it to be no matter how bad we want it. Because it’s out of our control.

Instead, pay attention to your own well being and do the things that can calm your nerves. Whether it be streaming your gameplays, watching your movies, or just hang in a call if you want to.

If the members really want to speak about the current events, **please keep it in the** #⊱・🗺️・international-discussion **or** #⊱・📰・global-news 

This is a communal space, please respect the needs and wants of one another.

Thank you","","🙏 (18),salute (9)"

hey guys, in case you need help on something specific let me remind you who to tag if you need help 

Server related matters: stickers, role color for server boosters, role emojis, bots: IJO
General help, member aid: LOTSO
Emergency 1, reporting a member, if a member is being a minor nuisance: EDEN
Emergency 2, reporting a member, anything serious, life threathening or server threathening: KONCO

If you need to consult on specific subject matter:
Law: LEON
Roleplay, DnD: Rose!
Architecture and Urban Planning: EDEN
Finance and Consultng: PROHIRE, LOTSO, KONCO

And also, some housekeeping:
I've noticed that there are alot of new forum posts in #⊱・📝・the-yap-forum lately, and some of them are overlapping with each other and it might lead to alot of clutter. This isn't mandated but I would appreciate it if members opened a #⊱・📩・support-ticket and let mods know they will be opening up a forum post with a brief statement on what it will be for. If mods do not respond within the day go ahead and open the forum post

On a personal note
I am trying to finish grad school, it's been tough so I'm not going to be around very much, but you probably knew that already. anything you need my help with try asking Lotso or shooting a DM if you really need me to know (~~and I probably do already jk~~)
