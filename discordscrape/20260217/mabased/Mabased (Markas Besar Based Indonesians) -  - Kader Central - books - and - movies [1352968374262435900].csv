`Le Samourai.` - Jean-Pierre Melville (1967) **(8/10)**

```""A slow, but a very cool movie nonetheless. From the title itself, everyone will misunderstood this for a Japanese movie made by a Frenchie but no. Jean Melville actually delves into the Bushido or the code of samurai and implements it on this character, portrayed by Alain Delon, otherise known as Jef Costello.

Jef Costello is an assassin working with only few uses of the tongue. He has a bird in his room, a pair of keys that he uses to hijack cars and a signature beige trenchcoat and gray hat whenever he goes around. He's silent, he's composed, and he embodies what a modern 'samurai' would look like. The movie has its own style in itself too, and oftentimes, it can be very intriguing.

Overall, this has to be one of those night-time movies to watch within the category of ""French New Wave"".```","",""

```""A movie of two stories, one a hitman who struggles to leave the criminal underworld, the other a mute ex-convict who met with a girl after getting dumped off by her boyfriend.

This movie will put you on a train of emotions, combined with the cinematic aesthetics of Wong Kar-Wai, and its choice of colors, this is honestly a pretty unique watch. You'll laugh, you'll cry, hell you'll be blasted with nostalgia and seldom-felt sonder. Some scenes will stick on the back of your head and even after multiple watches of this movie, it had stained you the moment you put this film down for a watch for the first time.

`Assault on Precinct 13` - John Carpenter (1976) **(8.5/10)**

```""Assault on Precinct 13, one of the underrated movies released by the legend, John Carpenter. It tells the story of one Lieutenant Ethan Bishop who is sent to take charge on a decommissioned precinct before it closes. However, a group of gangsters who signed themselves a blood pact plans to assault the precinct as an act of revenge. These events later on would determine if the precinct stays standing on its foundations or ravaged.

This film has a wild west taste to it, and Carpenter still delivers on the thriller aspect of the movie. Coupled with some not-over-the-top but carefully thought out action where both characters struggle to defend the precinct from ever getting breached by these gangsters. It's truly spectacular, it was an awesome watch but it gets underwhelming in some parts of the movie.

Overall, a very interesting watch from Carpenter himself.""```","",""

`À bout de souffle / Breathless` - Jean-Luc Godard (1960) **(9/10)**

```""Another cool cinematic masterpiece of the classic French New Wave, this time coming from the likes of Jean-Luc Godard. And like Godard's way of telling stories, the characters are oddly playful, giving it a sense of comedy in everything. Nevertheless, this is a romantic story of a criminal on the run who later found a woman as the police continued to tail him down.

Everything about this movie just oozes in the aesthetics you would normally find in any romantic movie, but if it's Godard we're talking about. There's more than just being romantic or crime-driven in its themes. The tension is there, and the plot twist at the end and that careful, confused send-off gave it all away for me. This movie is why I have loved Godard ever since I first watched it when I was 15 years old, and rewatching it feels like nostalgia all over again.

Definitely a must-see for those who wants to plunge in to the French New Wave.""```","",""

the main problem came from Apocalypse Virus spread across Japan, the psychological horror might not really that thrilling but it does cover up extreme human interaction facing fearmongering due to the virus spread, fighting each other just to survive

the story itself revolves around the cyclical nature of conflict and the difficulty of finding a path towards genuine peace, even when it requires difficult choices and sacrifices. 
- The Cycle of Violence
- The Cost of Freedom
- The Burden of Choice

Severance is an ongoing thriller, sci-fi, and mystery series by Apple TV that’s directed by the well-known, Emmy-winning director Ben Stiller. In season 1, Severance had 9 episodes.

The story follows a world where a company with the name Lumon has this unique procedure that has to make their workers brains to be split in half, not allowing their memory in the work place to be preserved outside of it, and the same goes for the outside memorises.

It’s like having two different lives and living as two different people but in the same body.
Our main character, Mark S. (portrayed by Adam Scott), leads the Macrodata Refinement department. With his subordinates, Irving B. (portrayed by John Turturro), Dylan G. (portrayed by Zach Cherry), and their newest addition, Helly R. (portrayed by Britt Lower), who replaced their past Chief, Petey K. (portrayed by Yul Vazquez).  We followed along those mundane office works to the most unpredictable ones together with the four Macrodata Refinement workers.

Season 1, so far, in my opinion, has incredible storytelling in both visual and auditory forms. They want us to feel isolated and at ease with the most absurd scenario or environment. Especially with its minimalist and precise work environment. I’m obsessed with the colours and cinematography in it. And as someone who’s constantly awkward, I find myself seeing that the characters here are way, way more awkward, so it made me feel at ease lol.

I can assure you that a lot of why's, what's, and how's are gonna come out of your mouth with each episode being watched.

If you like conspiracy, mystery amongs industry, and a little bit of cult in it. Severance might be a great series to get you invested. 

I cannot talk about Severance without spoilering it, but there will be queer characters and people dying. 

With that, I’ll give Severance Season 1 a ⅘ star.","","pray (5),pepeOK (2),👍 (1)"

for me though i think there is a lack of any kind of media that talks about the racially-motivated violence that happened in '98. especially as gen z i think people tend to shove off inter-ethnic conflicts between ""pribumi"" and ""chindo"" as something of the past. though in reality, the conflict is quite far from over. there are still heat and sparks going on. so i'm *really* glad that there is even one big movie bringing up this subject.||","","👍 (1)"

"862982841427820574","chewiezzz","2025-05-05T12:46:15.0240000+00:00","I like how the movie confronts generational trauma head-on in the movie, especially in the beginning to set up the mood for the rest of the movie. The inter-ethnic conflict runs deeper than just racial imo, there's also religious conflict mentioned in the movie, albeit just a little. But I think the core moral message is about how father figure is important, and Joko Anwar uses the tragedy of 98 to provide a more dramatic background to communicate that message, so people's opinion are not entirely wrong there.

As for the media, I think it's because racial and religious conflict is still considered a ""taboo"" to be discussed in depth here, but I am sure glad that Joko Anwar made a movie about it, so I expect there will be more discussions in podcast or other independent media in social media about these issues soon.

Speaking from experience, as I'm a chindo male also, some chindo girl (not all ofc) tends to see non-chindo girl as ""inferior"" and that she has to marry another chindo male to keep the blood ""pure"" so to speak. So, the chindo chick may feel irritated that she lose to a non-chindo girl in the ""romantic competition"".","","👍 (2)"

and yes, i also remember that line about that religious conflict - it's ||edwin's neighbors complaining that they're not allowed to pray & have a hard time building a church, right?|| - i really relate to that and i'm glad this line somehow makes it into the end cut. because it is just a fact that is currently happening, and not really being talked about openly.","","👍 (2)"
