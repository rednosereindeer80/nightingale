Us youngins see him as just another name in Indonesian politics, but a lot of oldies know that this is the only man Prabowo Subianto fears. Wiranto was probably the villain of the Reformation era (contrasting Amien Rais as the hero). He started off his career as a military officer in the 1960s far away from the capital, in Manado. He managed to climb his way into the prestigious Kostrad (Komando Cadangan Strategis Angkatan Darat) who were the most well equiped and well trained and became a brigade commander. 

Wiranto gained his bars in Kostrad because it was politically close with the government and his time in Kostrad led to him being chosen as an aide-de-champ to none other than **Soeharto**. His time with Soeharto won him brownie points and then he was selected as the Commander of Kostrad. It was during this time that Wiranto was involved in military factionalism and joined the nationalist camp of the military alongside former president SBY, former PSSI chairman Agum Gumelar and Soekarno loyalist Hendropriyono.

When 1997 strike Indonesia with financial crisis, Wiranto began distancing himself from Soeharto. As Panglima TNI, Wiranto took actions that was independent of Soeharto's orders and was suspected by Soeharto to harbour treasonous sentiments. He balanced Soeharto's worries, with his own political ambitions and with the security of the state.

In 1998, Wiranto refused to listen to Soeharto's orders anymore as the Indonesian economy worsens, and the riots intensifies, holding Soeharto's safety hostage. In a combination of Amien Rais' provocation, the activists involvement, Harmoko's betrayal, Soeharto finally gave in to the pressure and stepped down.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1148652142664626376/1199254681843683390/Wiranto-Suharto-AFP.png?ex=69961335&is=6994c1b5&hm=4e5a6e0f6a510fbf0f4b0e459dff5a77270ba6162f8606920e8df9a4bf5fb521&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1148652142664626376/1199254682758033478/Wiranto2.png?ex=69961335&is=6994c1b5&hm=25445e4e81754c145b2c1836154e417a4d6b7eb045974267ce38a5359d296a75&","🥲 (1)"

As an econ undergrad I've been reading some papers about our country — specifically about our country's welfare as measured by the Human Development Index and bits and bobs about human capital.

When evaluating the welfare of a nation, indicators like IPM, HDI, HCI observe three aspects of said nation: their economic wellbeing (income per capita), their health (survivability rate/life expectancy), and education (years of schooling or literacy rate)

Indonesia's most critical aspect is education above anything else

Healthcare has been getting better here. Although inequality remains prominent, on average, the figures are pretty good. Increasing life expectancy, low mortality rate for newborns. Our health infrastructure seems to be getting better as well, above 50% of households in Indo have access to basic healthcare and sanitation. The trend for income is also increasing, I guess to an extent.

Education though, is something else I think. The participation rate decreases for every education level: at the top, only about 6% of Indonesians go to college in 2022 (data from BPS).

It's also not a big news that our PISA score is far behind the others, but not only that, it's actually been decreasing for the past few years

The effects I would like to think are quite big too for the working force

I once read this report from LPEM FEB UI. From there I got to know that the one sector which absorbs the most labour in Indo, agriculture, contributes to the lowest share of our national income. The labor share has been decreasing in that sector whilst its share remains stagnant, implying efficiency and also movement in the labor force. But even though there's been a noticeable movement in labor, turns out those people could only shift to other low-wage sectors 😓

Makes me think that our country is in dire needddd of more accessible education","",""

This question is about 'working at BIN' and not 'working for BIN'.

People who work for BIN are divided into two 'castes'.

First, the 'officer' caste (those who work at BIN), which includes:

Individuals recruited, selected, and trained by BIN through official education programs.

Intelligence officers from the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) or National Police (Polri) who are assigned to BIN.

Civil servants with special expertise. They may come from the Directorate General of Taxation, Customs, the Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (PPATK), the Attorney General's Office, etc.

Second, the 'non-commissioned officer' and 'enlisted' caste. These are:

Individuals with influence and information networks, such as leaders of mass organizations, motorcycle gangs, or thugs.

Recruits and assets managed by intelligence officers. Field intelligence agents like Pollycarpus and Gun Jack certainly have an 'officer' as their superior.```

```In addition to these two groups, BIN also has administrative staff, like any other government agency. However, this is not particularly interesting to discuss.

Next, I would like to clarify some misconceptions about BIN personnel.

First, graduates of BIN's official education program (now STIN) belong to the officer caste, and they do not disguise themselves as street food vendors (or similar professions). Intelligence officers act as supervisors for field agents. If they do go into the field, their targets are high-profile figures. For example, if I wanted to spy on Donald Trump, would it make sense for me to disguise myself as a hot dog vendor in front of the White House? It would be much better to pose as a diplomat or journalist with access to the White House, right?```","",""
"776844764770861127","snuckel4","2025-03-09T13:19:34.8510000+00:00","```Second, there is often suspicion that BIN monitors the internet. This is not entirely incorrect. The internet is monitored by both BIN and the National Cyber Agency (formerly Lemsaneg). However, there is a difference in how BIN and the Cyber Agency operate. The Cyber Agency can crawl the internet and extract the data they want, while BIN does this manually. If both agencies were monitoring Quora, the Cyber Agency would look for any posts from anyone that they find 'interesting'. On the other hand, BIN would only monitor 'dangerous' posts made by users with significant influence (e.g., those with many followers) or users suspected of being involved in certain networks (e.g., terrorism). So, if a user with few followers writes something 'dangerous', BIN would most likely ignore it.

There was once a rumor that BIN had a big data base monitoring the internet. This is clearly a hoax, not because Indonesia couldn't do it, but because even if such a thing existed, it would be the job of the Cyber Agency, not BIN (although collaboration between BIN and the Cyber Agency is not impossible).

Finally, if you're interested in becoming an intelligence officer, apply to STIN. Being an intelligence officer carries risks similar to being a soldier. If you reach the officer level, you typically won't be doing dangerous work (though there are always exceptions, hehe). As long as the intelligence officer doesn't do anything foolish (e.g., giving orders to kill via a personal cell phone, as in the Munir case), they will remain invisible and undetected.```","",""

In regards to this topic, we often forget that we have a Government Structure that has been formed and agreed upon, one above the other; can't argue nor go against that.

This discussion about the Military being able to be assigned/tasked within the Government happened during a Meeting by Komisi I of DPR, a discussion in which the goal was to revise the Constitution (specifically UU TNI)

If **I were to be in this situation**, there are many lengths to go through such as attempting to form an Independent Body; where their tasks are to oversee, review, and evaluate such Military Activity within the Government. This unforutnately doesn't remove the Military from Government business, however this still instills authority for the Civillians against the Military (basically telling the Military that we are all different and that you have no authority in this business lol)

If that couldn't be done, then **atleast do a weekly/monthly evaluation or review of what the military has been doing within the government.** This encourages transparency and we can also do a forum where most debates/decision making happens, whatever idk","",""

**Observe**, watch surrounding, everything, every detail.

After the quantity increases from 80celc to 100celc, the nature changes: Water becomes vapor, quantity becomes quality. change in number (quantity) becomes a change in nature (quality). from water to vapor. 
> Dialectics concludes the movement of “yes” and “no” with a “Negation der negation”. The “yes” is initially canceled. This negation is also canceled. Let's take a grain of rice and plant it. After a while the rice seed is no longer a seed, but has become a tree. This is one negation: The tree produces more seeds than it started with. Here there is a nullification of the tree: The seed canceled the tree. In the whole process, the rice play, we have the rice seed, the tree (invalidation) and many rice seeds (nullification). This is what is named: Negation der negation""

Quantitative change overturning into qualitative change is true, but all of these dogmatic natural examples are indeed products of Engels' shitty philosophy in DoN and Anti-Duhring
It's always wrong to use these examples because they're cyclical, the negation of the negation is the negation of negation as such. A good example is Marx explaining the negation of the negation of private property, where private property goes through its determinate negation / positive negation when it's extended to a universal level and the negation of the negation follows when society has forgotten about property entirely.","",""

> ""Social-Democracy bases its whole world-outlook on scientific socialism, i. e., Marxism. The philosophical basis of Marxism, as Marx and Engels repeatedly declared, is dialectical materialism, which has fully taken over the historical traditions of eighteenth-century materialism in France and of Feuerbach (first half of the nineteenth century) in Germany—a materialism which is absolutely atheistic and positively hostile to all religion. Let us recall that the whole of Engels’s Anti-Dühring, which Marx read in manuscript, is an indictment of the materialist and atheist Dühring for not being a consistent materialist and for leaving loopholes for religion and religious philosophy. Let us recall that in his essay on Ludwig Feuerbach, Engels reproaches Feuerbach for combating religion not in order to destroy it, but in order to renovate it, to invent a new, “exalted” religion, and so forth. Religion is the opium of the people—this dictum by Marx is the corner-stone of the whole Marxist outlook on religion. Marxism has always regarded all modern religions and churches, and each and every religious organisation, as instruments of bourgeois reaction that serve to defend exploitation and to befuddle the working class.

Religious thought arose out of the same historical developments as any other philosophy

> Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality.

Religion is an attempt to understand the world, to understand one's self-conscience; while simultaneously not accepting one's real autonomy. Humans exist within society, and religion is an invention of society, religion serves to comfort people, serves to provide knowledge, morality, answers to questions of our purpose and task in society, with the promise of an afterlife as an award for this dedication.","",""

While hard work and talent matter, privilege provides critical advantages: financial safety nets allow full academic focus without survival concerns, while social connections open doors regardless of ability. Truly merit-based opportunities typically require exceptional talent from underprivileged individuals, demanding they be ""the top 1% of the top 1%"" to access what average students with privilege obtain easily. Meanwhile, universities have transformed from affordable knowledge centers to expensive economic necessities, with tuition costs doubling in just a few years, further entrenching these advantages.

Well, where do I start? Humans made mistakes. They always do. In many fields, mistakes are never left in the hands of mankind. From my personal observation on the matter, I grew up in a place where people often do not learn from their mistakes. In school, even now, whenever I see my friends making a mistake and the teacher points it out, they only say ""yes"" or ""sorry, I would not do it again,"" like they wouldn't, but in fact they still did. And let me say, back then, I was a part of that demographic. I lash out whenever my mistakes are being displayed right in front of me, or argue about that mistake more and say that I didn't do it or I didn't have the intention to do it, while I did and then start blaming them, an example of my ad hominem.

*""But the heart has its own memory, and I have forgotten nothing.""*

- Albert Camus, The Fall.

Depression hits me like a wildfire; it entrenched you deep, and you are overwhelmed with the sense of hopelessness, the thought that the world will see and will hate you for it for what you have done. But in the middle of this torturous epoch, I saw an answer that I had to search myself, not by books, not by philosophies, not by anything external. But myself. I was stupid back then; you can expect how stupid I am simply from the fact that I hated studying and always got addicted to video games in my childhood, but through that answer, I finally became open, free, kind, and a bit understanding. Since then, the word 'sorry' has been embedded into my mind, and I will always say it whenever I make a mistake. No matter if they forgive me or not, it is better to say it than to say nothing.

*""Don't be like me, but follow what I do that you consider good.""*

Truly, one way to find yourself a peaceful solitude is to learn how to accept yourself, learn how to forgive yourself, and learn how to make an effort to make yourself better before you decide to make others better. Don't focus on influencing the materials of the world that is out of your control. Depression can be resolved by learning how to accept, and if you ever need assistance, please reach out. The world may be going against you, but those who know you, those that understand you better than anybody, will come to help you at your lowest. Reminding you that not all is coming against you. To become your own Ubermensch, is to wage war with your own body and claim the first and best victory, that is to **conquer yourself.**","","💯 (1)"

""Bourgeois law"" recognizes them as the private property of individuals. Socialism converts them into common property. To that extent--and to that extent alone--""bourgeois law"" disappears.

However, it persists as far as its other part is concerned; it persists in the capacity of regulator (determining factor) in the distribution of products and the allotment of labor among the members of society. The socialist principle, ""He who does not work shall not eat"", is already realized; the other socialist principle, ""An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor"", is also already realized. But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish ""bourgeois law"", which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products.

This is a “defect”, says Marx, but it is unavoidable in the first phase of communism; for if we are not to indulge in utopianism, we must not think that having overthrown capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law. Besides, the abolition of capitalism does not immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change.

Now, there are no other rules than those of ""bourgeois law"". To this extent, therefore, there still remains the need for a state, which, while safeguarding the common ownership of the means of production, would safeguard equality in labor and in the distribution of products.","",""

What is the correlation between this and my original point which is Socialism and DoTP being different eras?
I didnt even say that after revolution it immideately goes to communism, im just saying that Socialism and DoTP is DIFFERENT !
If you disagree with me, you disagree with Marx in Critique of the Gotha Programme saying that lower phase communism is ""communism not as it has developed, but as it arises from capitalist society"" and then saying that ""the revolutionary era of transformation, the dictatorship of the proletariat"" or something to that accord

Also something funny is that Lenin is talking about a different thing here. This is a mistranslation (Apparent by the very weird terminology)
Lenin's terminology is very weird here, I'd even say incorrect, because Marx makes it clear that the proletariat can't take hold of the bourgeois machinery and Lenin also acknowledges this in State and Revolution too. Maybe it's a fault of mistranslation in one way or another, because Marx never uses ""bourgeois law"" either but ""bourgeois right"", and in Russian the word for right/law is the same. I don't think it's correct to imply that a class state (or state as a state) exists under LPS,  Marx describes bourgeois right just as the principle which governs commodity exchange, and in Conspectus in Bakunin he mentions that the state disappears with class rule (Engels also reiterates this by saying that once the state serves society as a whole, and no longer struggles against a class, the state as a state is abolished, and it starts withering away), and obviously the bourgeoisie no longer exist in Lower Phase Communism, because there is no longer the class relation which exclusively owns the means of production and enslaves the propertyless mass with wage labour, there are only producers (which Lenin also says in the same passage where he calls the state ""bourgeois"").
So really, we are talking about different things entirely !!","",""

2 years ago, Thai restaurants started popping up in bigger numbers. And I’m not talking about your usual cheap Thai takeout. These were restaurants that were featured and mentioned in good food guides.

Indonesia? We have so much potential but we’re lagging. There’s this hesitance to innovate and also we really pander to Western tastes way too much.

When I spoke to a few Indo restaurant owners here in Melb, they’re… old school. To add to it, the rising cost of wages in Aus makes it really hard to sustain a restaurant business.

There’s opportunities for sure. We’re not capitalising it - or maybe we’ve lost the wave that Korean restaurants rode 5 years ago.","",""

An average Indonesian will know what is an Indonesian product and content creator, but they won't know what is an IP for many of its cases. Thus, we need an incentive to make people understand what is IP, starting with creative communities and some simplified videos, explaining about what is IP. I've seen some videos talking about IP and its definition but they lacked views while being in podcast format. For faster application and strengthening, I suggest for the upgrade of DGIP first along with help and recruitment centers being built for local influencers being able to apply for it. 

Another idea is to create: 

""Rumah IP Nasional (IP Bersama, IP Merah Putih, etc, you can come up with a good name),"" an institution that is centralized or public-private center for IP Education, legal aid for creators, and even cultural preservation for traditional cultures, while it can be built in Yogyakarta, Bandung and Denpasar as creative cities.","",""

1. In Canada, the natives were having forced assimilation though a less militarized version like in the US. As a matter of fact, the Native American were treated much better under the Canadian though not spotless in their marginalization history against the natives. There are more visible political engagement with Indigenous leaders in Canada than in the US. Just like any Native American, they were also dying in population due to their lower populace yet wiped out by smallpox and other diseases. Furthermore similarly like Australia, they are still divided by tribes, but less technologically inferior and have some edges. They even learn and become auxilaries for the colonial forces, especially during French Indian War and American War of Independence.
2. US is a whole pack to unpack. The most devastated ones were obviously the western native Americans due to the first arrival of the colonies. And with some similar reasons, like the smallpox, they got wiped out more in those sectors rather than wars. Some fought due to warlike culture, some fought when their lands are getting stolen or occupied by settlers, and others did for defenses. Meanwhile the Midwest and Eastern Native Americans though managed to avoid the similar fate like the the western Native Americans, also faced some migrations from these native tribes, in which some migrating tribes even fought each other or against other already settled tribes in there. The Southern Native Americans in US suffered some similar fate like the Western Native Americans, but with some of the most famous battles and resistance (my favorite one: Seminole). Midwest also got consolidated later on, with eastern and southeastern natives became the last consolidated ones as they basically become what you've seen in Wild West movies about the Indians. They adopted horses and even use them a lot.","",""

Mexico: There are a lot to cover in there, but what most people didn't know is that the natives in there were still relied on by the Spanish during colonial era. As a matter of fact, due to the lack of colonial populace in Mexico, many native rulers are still installed during its early colonization after Aztec Empire got destroyed, but as a bunch of puppets. Spanish also encouraged intermarriages as many native american elites married Spanish aristocracy to continued producing heirs. These people are what we known today as Mestizo (native and Spaniard blood). During 19th century, the Aztecs were painted in a much lighter picture since the Mexican independence (as a form of cultural agenda to rival the superior European culture). Even then, the fact that these natives are still done dirty by the Mexicans in certain cases such as poverty and inequality. Caste War of Yucatán broke out which proved to be one of the most successful native revolt in early modern era, though later on defeated. Thus the natives in Mexico is more resistant against the colonial forces with Mexican independence that were done by mix natives and other ethnic groups proved how the natives somewhat more successful than the other natives, but ironically, the Latinos didn't really see the natives (or more pure blooded ones) as their own brothers as tensions are still there during that period.","",""

Just like the other natives, they suffered mortality rate from diseases like influenza, smallpox and measles. Until the 1860's, conflicts between Maoris and colonial government is generally limited and ended with peace deals due to lower population of British colonists. Only in 1860's does the situation further broke out into an all out war between New Zealand colonial government against various Maoris tribes (Search New Zealand Wars).

I was meant to say that the Natives were treated much better under the Canadian, but I didn't realized that. The natives did get better treatment but still horrible nevertheless in their own parts of history. I will say tho, in early colonial Canada, First Nations were treated as nations better than your average colonial settlers. This is mainly due to three things: 
1. Low colonial population 
2. Resource routes
3. Treaty Protection

Early eras of colonization is understandable since the populace in Canada are not dominating in terms of its colonial settlers compared to the 13 colonies. Thus there are compromises being made as the British and its colonial government had to recognized the importance of the natives as political actors. Sometimes they even used these natives for their own wars including French Indian Wars, American Revolutionary War and even in 1812 War. Though later on these usage of natives would be limited, they played early importance due to the fact that the British were lacking in manpower. And to anger a bunch of tribes that had given you their voluntary manpower would not be the wisest move in politics. The resource one is obvious considering the natives had been working with Hudson Bay Company in fur trade. Some natives even hold some rivers and important routes for the fur trade, in which the British had to treat these people with a friendly approach or at least diplomatically mutual if they did not want to lose their access for fur trade. Compare that to some colonial settlers in remote areas who were struggling to survive, indebted to trading posts, and had no influence in decision-making. Lastly for the treaty, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 recognized the natives land rights to not be settled by the British. Though in all fairness, later on these treaties will be broken multiple times in the future by the Brits themselves.","",""

While some early interactions were based on mutual respect and cooperation, I am questioning how long did it last?  Per your explanation, native rights were broke in late 18th century, but there was history of a bounty for indigenous scalps as early as the 1700s for example. My understanding, the respect and cooperation didn't last for long.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-11T18:26:19.3080000+00:00","Ah yes, what I meant by native rights were things such as lands since I did mentioned the treaty beforehand. And you are right to say that the respect and cooperation didn't last for long, ever since the recognition for the natives was nothing but a strategic necessity to begin with (and I mentioned before the British needed to do this to secure trade routes while attaining some auxilaries). Europeans were few in number and needed Indigenous alliances, knowledge, trade access, and military support from 1600's to early 1700's. It is only when colonial population grew in size and power when that respect had been lost and broken on larger picture. Then about the Indigenous scalping, it was mostly happen in the 13 colonies than in Canada to begin with. Though in all respect, there are a few events of scalping happening in Canada, but less like in the other colonies. One notable example is the Mi'kmaq militias who fought against the British in Father Le Loutre’s War where the British did issued a scalping bounty on the Mi'kmaq who had been known to be a long time ally for the French. Yet even then, the natives fought more against the British in 13 colonies than in Canada, exceptions can be given when they are at war against the French. Thus there aren't a lot of conflicts between the natives and the Canadian settlers (generally speaking), alas the relation between the natives and Canadians are somewhat better than what the other British settlements in 13 colonies experienced, even after becoming independent.","",""

Today, any public event (concert, church service, etc) will start with the native land acknowledgement proclamation by the host of the event. 

I don't recall the same thing happening in the US. 

Canadian gov also offered (my understanding Australian gov is also doing the same thing?):
1. Official apology
2. Creating reconciliation policy by creating and implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, UNDRIP, etc. 

I don't recall the US gov providing an official apology for example which this book explained why imo: https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Myths_America_Lives_By/6cFwDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0

From his movement so far recently, one can state that he helps manage legislative strategy and maintain alliances. Moreover, he is responsible for possibly behind-the-scenes role in coalition negotiations and party consolidation. From a glance, he is the shadow negotiator, but actually playing a part in unifying the forces together, including the coalition of Gerindra.
2. Hasyim: Chairman of the KPU. Dud was basically playing a part in election regulation and management, especially during the 2024 election. He holds institutional power, though under questions for his neutrality. From his position alone, he can be a key player in shaping how electoral laws are interpreted and implemented.
3. Muzani: Obviously the Secretary General of Gerindra and DPR member at the same time. He is at least one of Prabowo’s most loyal lieutenants and inner-circle strategists based on his position and moves. From his position and decisions, he mainly helped Gerindra maintain internal cohesion and plays a possible kingmaker role in legislative politics.
4. Sjafrie: a retired general, and a former Deputy Minister of Defense from SBY era. Many already known him for his influence and possible shadow connections in the military, including defense-related policies. Though not mainly active, I can tell he played somewhat of an informal advisor  while being a part of the military elites.

Suffice to say, in English School Theory, states are seen as members of international society. Nah, in their interactions on each other itself is an act of social activity, specifically diplomatic interactions as a socialization for states. Thus why foreign policy according to the theory, it becomes a way for states whether they want to interact, communicate, and reinforce or challenge norms within that society (their ongoing interactions will be known as Society of States).","",""

For Linklater and Suganami, they both highlight it as a moral and normative benchmark for states. It’s essentially a way to think about responsible behavior within the society of states. So when a state acts as a good international citizen, it reinforces the shared values and order of international society. It is a social expectation that is expected from them to do as a member of Society of States. Fulfilling it will grant them various benefits (recognition, legitimacy and influence).","",""

Though I am happy people are taking in the same field as me, I must put a disclaimer as a former International Relations student: A degree in IR is practically useless if you're starting up from nothing because IR is a broad field that is more affiliated with academic circles, so as an IR student you're pushed to be a social scientist rather than a politician or diplomat. People that wanna take IR and do consulting or become a diplomat I suggest you guys take a different, more specialized field like Law or Governance or Sociology. Otherwise, your network game needs to be better and you need to be specialized in a certain field, especially if you graduate from universities that are not UI or UGM.","","⭐ (14),🔥 (5)"

Back when I was voluntarily recruited to advise a kader doing his caleg run. He once had asked me about how to beat Gibran one on one since both of them are ""younger"" candidates. And I said: ""you don't fight a prince on his throne, you fight him on the streets when his crown wasn't there. You don't stab him, but you let the people make a mockery of him, let the masses judge him if he lives by the masses support. You on the other hand, has to be one that could move that masses, which you don't have right now as he holds them by their golds.""

There are a few things I've advised that are similar to what Buzzer stated here, so I will elaborate it:

1. Differentiate a clear vision and values
In order to beat Gibran, one must have the opposite yet strong image than him. Obvious choices for images would be meritocracy and clean governance, yet the thing is: not many can achieve it. A few that did, usually didn't have enough exposure to create that strong image. In terms of vision and values, Gibran is still lacking in communicating his plans for national security, education, economic transformation, and foreign policy. If you are his rival, you must enhance yourself in those sectors since those are what he mainly lacks. Expose him in that sector, then prove yourself that you are a more capable person for the job as a whole.
2. Smart Use of Media and Social Media
The usage of social media and AI promotions are where Gibran's promotional campaign shine during 2024. There is no doubt that Gibran will use it again if that was what can make him win two times in a row, both Mayorship and Vice Presidency. Gibran benefits from Jokowi’s media footprint and his advertisement. You as a rival need savvy digital campaigns with humor, clarity, and emotional resonance, including memes too (to both get youth support and needed exposure for your campaign).","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-24T10:11:47.4030000+00:00","3. Public Debates & Dialogues
One thing that I heavily noticed, is the fact Gibran tends to be reserved and sometimes avoid debates. Mainly because we can saw that he is not good for a debater or a proper charismatic figure, at least not yet, so there is a good reason why we don't see him being recorded to speak in intellectual dialogues. But just like Buzzer stated, in those debates and dialogues, try to not approach him aggressively by attacking his statements. Try to focus on your policies, solutions and explaining it even further so you could be seen as a comprehensive figure that actually answered the questions in details. I knew that many Javanese tend to avoid debates, conflicts, and disagreements, but are willing to do discussions for the sake of harmony. It is crucial to make yourself can tackle his weak points and statements yet in a manner that is not ""attacking"" but ""helping"" and being genuine about your solutions for greater good.
4. Grassroots & Coalition Building
For the coalition part, I believe Buzzer had explained it very well. But for grassroots, I will note this is where Gibran can hold it as his strong points. After all, the bansos system was used to win the campaign in rural areas. Thus your strong points in winning the rural areas should not be coming welfare alone (giving bansos). Instead of just giving aid, build community empowerment programs (you should do this since day one before you even get into presidential race tho) like cooperative farming, digital literacy, or micro-business incubation. If resources allow, create symbolic yet practical rival programs. Contohnya “Warung Rakyat Mandiri,” a people-run food cooperative, or a volunteer-based community clinic that shows what people-led welfare looks like. Of course this is very ambitious and resource consuming programs, thus you will need a huge financial backing since day one.","",""

Berlari

 Opini
Mengenang Chairil Anwar: Menulis sebagai Perlawanan Sunyi

Mahyudin. Direktur Riset dan Publikasi Yayasan Sukma

DALAM buku 
 Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein menulis, “Tentang apa yang tidak dapat kita bicarakan, kita harus berdiam diri.” Namun, di dunia Chairil Anwar, keheningan justru dilawan dengan kata-kata. Puisi lahir dari keterdesakan untuk berbicara saat dunia membisu.

Di tengah krisis literasi, menulis menjadi bentuk perlawanan sunyi, menjaga kemanusiaan dalam bahasa yang kian kehilangan makna di ruang pendidikan formal. Di sebuah kelas di Aceh, seorang siswa membacakan puisinya tentang ibu, gempa, dan harapan menjadi guru—dengan kejujuran yang menyentuh. Puisinya akan diterbitkan, bukti bahwa literasi masih bisa menemukan ruang untuk bertumbuh.","",""

Di saat yang sama, di banyak sekolah lain di negeri ini, siswa masih sibuk menyalin kalimat di papan tulis. 
 Buku yang mereka kenal hanyalah LKS, dan menulis berarti menyalin dan menjawab soal. Membaca? Kadang hanya tugas. Di negeri yang merayakan Hari Puisi Nasional, banyak anak yang bahkan tak tahu cara menikmati puisi.

Inilah paradoks kita hari ini: kata-kata diagungkan dalam seremoni, tapi sering diabaikan dalam praktik pendidikan. Kita mengenang Chairil Anwar dan puisi-puisi perjuangannya, tapi kita lupa bahwa perjuangan literasi hari ini jauh lebih senyap dan kompleks—berhadapan dengan sistem yang masih menomorduakan bacaan bermakna dan pembelajaran yang jarang memberi ruang ekspresi.","",""

Hari Puisi Nasional yang kita peringati setiap tahun seharusnya lebih dari sekadar nostalgia. Ia adalah alarm. Tanda bahwa bangsa ini sedang krisis dalam hal paling mendasar: kemampuan membaca, menulis, dan berpikir.

Namun, di tengah krisis ini, masih ada ruang-ruang kecil yang menyalakan lentera harapan. Sekolah-sekolah seperti Sekolah Sukma Bangsa membuktikan bahwa menulis bisa menjadi budaya. Bahwa membaca bisa dirayakan. Dan bahwa puisi—seperti yang pernah ditulis Chairil—masih bisa menjadi senjata perlawanan, bukan dengan amarah, tetapi dengan kesadaran.","",""

LITERASI: TANTANGAN DAN PERJUANGAN ABAD 21
Literasi merupakan salah satu kunci penting dalam meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan. Namun, Indonesia masih menghadapi tantangan besar. Berdasarkan hasil survei PISA 2018, kemampuan membaca siswa Indonesia masih sebatas menghafal, belum mencapai pemahaman. Ini bukan sekadar angka PISA 2018 yang menempatkan Indonesia di peringkat ke-72 dari 77 negara, melainkan potret nyata ruang kelas yang kehilangan kepekaan terhadap makna kata.","",""

Literasi tidak lagi cukup dipahami sebagai kemampuan membaca permukaan. Literasi modern mencakup kemampuan memahami informasi, berpikir kritis, dan menyampaikan gagasan secara efektif (UNESCO, 2017). Maka, membangun budaya literasi adalah perjuangan zaman ini—dan salah satu ujung tombaknya ialah guru.
Sekolah dan guru tidak bisa hanya berfungsi sebagai penyampai materi. Mereka harus menjadi penggerak literasi.

 Bukan sekadar menugasi siswa membaca dan menulis, tetapi juga menciptakan ruang-ruang hidup di mana kata-kata memiliki makna, refleksi, dan kekuatan untuk mengubah cara berpikir","",""

BUDAYA LITERASI SEBAGAI GERAKAN
Dalam lanskap pendidikan yang masih didominasi oleh pengajaran hafalan dan capaian nilai kognitif, Sekolah Sukma Bangsa mengambil jalan berbeda. Sejak awal, sekolah ini membangun budaya belajar yang meletakkan literasi sebagai jantungnya. Bagi mereka, membaca dan menulis bukan sekadar keterampilan, tetapi cara berpikir dan bertumbuh.
Budaya literasi di sekolah ini tidak hadir sebagai program tambahan, melainkan ditanamkan dalam denyut harian kehidupan sekolah. Program seperti Reading Day
 menjadi momen mingguan yang dinantikan siswa. Bukan hanya karena mereka membaca buku, tetapi karena mereka membaca dalam suasana yang hidup dan penuh dialog. Siswa boleh memilih buku yang mereka suka, mendiskusikannya, bahkan mengadaptasinya ke dalam puisi, drama, atau cerita gambar.

Dari budaya membaca, siswa kemudian didorong menulis. Bukan sekadar menulis karena tugas, tapi karena mereka punya cerita. Program Siswa Menulis memberikan ruang bagi anak-anak untuk mengekspresikan pengalaman, imajinasi, dan keresahan mereka. Yang lebih luar biasa, karya-karya ini tidak berhenti di laci atau map portofolio—mereka diterbitkan dan dirayakan melalui acara tahunan bernama Kenduri Buku.

Di sinilah pendidikan literasi mencapai bentuk idealnya: ketika membaca menjadi kebiasaan dan menulis menjadi ekspresi jati diri. Namun, transformasi semacam ini tidak mungkin terjadi tanpa peran sentral guru.","",""

GURU MENULIS: GURU SEBAGAI PEMIKIR DAN PRODUSEN PENGETAHUAN

Di Sekolah Sukma Bangsa, guru tidak hanya berperan sebagai pengajar, tetapi juga sebagai penulis dan pemikir dalam dunia pendidikan. Melalui Program Guru Menulis, para pendidik didorong menulis esai, opini, refleksi pembelajaran, hingga artikel ilmiah yang dipublikasikan di media massa dan Jurnal Sukma, yang menjadi wadah bagi mereka untuk berbagi praktik baik, studi kasus, dan hasil penelitian tindakan kelas, memperkuat peran mereka sebagai praktisi reflektif.

Aktivitas ini membangun kepercayaan diri mereka, menguatkan identitas sebagai praktisi reflektif, dan menjadikan mereka produsen pengetahuan, bukan sekadar pelaksana kebijakan.

Selain itu, guru-guru di sekolah ini juga terlibat dalam pengembangan buku ajar lintas disiplin, yang ditulis dengan pendekatan kontekstual dan humanis, memastikan materi ajar sesuai dengan kebutuhan dan pengalaman siswa, bukan sekadar terjemahan kurikulum.

Namun, kita harus bertanya, apakah kita sudah menciptakan lingkungan di mana kata-kata memiliki kekuatan untuk mengubah? Guru dan sekolah harus berperan sebagai agen perubahan, memastikan literasi bukan hanya tugas, tetapi juga perlawanan sunyi yang mempertahankan hakikat berpikir dan merasa.

Sekolah dan guru harus memilih: menjadi penggerak yang menumbuhkan dunia baru atau membiarkan ruang-ruang belajar terus membisu. Karena, di dunia yang kian bising, menulis tetaplah cara paling sunyi untuk bertahan.","",""

Diringkas dari Jurnal El-Banat berjudul 'Rekonstruksi Makna Semboyan Ki Hajar Dewantara dalam Praktik Pendidikan Islam' oleh Alaika M Bagus Kurnia PS dkk, berikut ini makna dari 3 semboyan pendidikan Ki Hajar Dewantara:

1. Ing Ngarsa Sung Tuladha
Sesuai arti literalnya, semboyan ini mengajarkan para guru untuk menjadi teladan bagi murid-muridnya. Sebab, guru yang baik akan menghasilkan murid yang baik pula. Hal ini dikarenakan tabiat siswa yang cenderung mengikuti perilaku guru.

Seorang guru juga berarti menyandang 2 status. Ia adalah seorang profesional sekaligus pendidik. Artinya, guru tidak hanya dituntut menguasai kompetensi pengajaran, tetapi juga diminta menjadi aktor sosial guna membentuk kepribadian murid-muridnya.

Baik tingkah laku maupun perkataan guru selama berinteraksi dengan siswanya harus bisa dipertanggungjawabkan. Alasannya, kedua hal tersebut punya peran penting terhadap perkembangan karakter siswa ke depan.

2. Ing Madya Mangun Karsa
Sudah bukan zamannya lagi bagi guru untuk membuat jarak dengan siswa-siswanya, terlebih saat ini era digital terus menyeruak. Para guru diharap bisa bersinggungan langsung dengan anak-anak didiknya. Dengan kata lain, guru mesti bisa menjelma menjadi sosok teman baik ataupun sahabat bagi murid-muridnya.

Berbekal kemajuan teknologi yang begitu pesat, penerapan semboyan Ing Madya Mangun Karsa dapat menjadi lebih mudah bagi guru. Jika dahulu guru harus repot-repot pergi jauh mengunjungi rumah siswa untuk bercengkerama, sekarang bisa dilakukan dengan bermodalkan internet saja.

Dalam proses pendekatan diri tersebut, guru juga tidak diperkenankan untuk menganggap anak didiknya lebih rendah. Alih-alih, seorang guru perlu bersikap layaknya teman baik yang siap menyambut segala macam ekspresi dari muridnya. Dengan demikian, murid merasa didukung untuk berkembang lebih jauh lagi.

3. Tut Wuri Handayani
Semboyan ketiga dari Ki Hajar Dewantara adalah petuah bagi guru untuk menjadi sosok pendorong kemajuan murid-muridnya. Agar tujuan dari semboyan tersebut bisa terlaksana, seorang guru tidak boleh hanya berpangku tangan, melainkan mesti berpartisipasi aktif.

Dorongan yang dimaksud dapat berwujud sokongan mental ataupun materiil. Dari segi mental, seorang guru mesti bisa membangkitkan api semangat di hati murid-muridnya untuk belajar menggapai cita-cita. Pun juga hal ini mesti diterapkan kepada semua siswa alias tidak terbatas.

Seorang guru harus berusaha maksimal untuk mendorong potensi terbaik anak didiknya. Semisal, ada anak yang pintar matematika, maka guru bisa memberi dukungan dengan mengikutsertakannya pada lomba. Sebaliknya, anak yang belum memahami matematika dengan baik perlu didukung semangatnya untuk belajar agar tidak menyerah.","",""

Konsep Tripusat Pendidikan Ki Hajar Dewantara
Tak hanya semboyan pendidikan, Ki Hajar Dewantara juga mengemukakan ide bernama Tripusat Pendidikan. Dikutip dari Jurnal Kependidikan berjudul 'Peran Tripusat Pendidikan dalam Membentuk Kepribadian Anak' oleh Siti Khusnul Bariyah, begini pembahasan ringkasnya:

1. Lingkungan Keluarga
Keluarga adalah lingkup terkecil tempat pendidikan seorang anak bermula. Dalam lingkup ini pulalah, seseorang diajarkan berbagai macam hal, seperti keagamaan, kesenian, hingga ilmu pengetahuan. Oleh karena itu, peran orang tua dalam pembentukan dasar kepribadian anak begitu penting.

2. Lingkungan Perguruan/Sekolah
Setelah keluarga, pendidikan kedua bagi anak adalah sekolah. Menurut Ki Hajar Dewantara, lingkungan sekolah dan keluarga mesti berkesinambungan agar tujuan pendidikan tercapai. Jika terpisah, pendidikan yang diterima anak di lingkungan keluarga menjadi sia-sia.

3. Lingkungan Kemasyarakatan
Lingkup pendidikan terakhir seorang anak adalah masyarakat. Sebab, di tempat inilah, anak-anak belajar pengalaman sosial yang nyata. Sama seperti dua hal sebelumnya, pendidikan di lingkungan kemasyarakatan juga mesti integral dengan lingkungan sekolah dan olahraga. Dengan kombinasi ini, anak dibentuk menjadi sosok manusia yang 'utuh'.","",""

Oleh: Rm. Patris Allegro, Pr

Terpilihnya Paus Leo XIV, seorang putra dari Chicago dan anggota Ordo Santo Agustinus, bukan sekadar pergantian kepemimpinan dalam Gereja Katolik. Ia adalah simbol sejarah yang berputar, jembatan yang membentang dari pusat dunia Protestan kembali ke rahim Katolik, dari negara yang dulunya menjadi tanah subur Reformasi, kembali kepada persatuan yang lebih dalam.

Bahwa paus baru berasal dari Amerika Serikat—negara dengan sejarah Protestan yang dominan, dengan warisan Martin Luther masih bergema dalam banyak gereja dan budaya—adalah sebuah peristiwa yang sarat makna. Dan bahwa ia berasal dari Ordo Santo Agustinus, ordo religius yang juga menaungi Luther sebelum perpecahan besar, menambahkan dimensi rohani yang tak terelakkan: sejarah sedang menyembuhkan dirinya sendiri.

Dalam pemilihannya, dunia menyaksikan sesuatu yang lebih besar dari sekadar pilihan seorang pemimpin rohani. Dunia menyaksikan sebuah gerakan pulang. Amerika, dalam dirinya, membawa pulang kembali warisan iman yang pernah ditinggalkan. Paus Leo XIV, dengan mottonya In illo uno unum – “Dalam Dia yang satu, kita menjadi satu” – mengundang dunia yang terpecah untuk kembali menyatu dalam Kristus.

Dari Barat yang sekular dan plural, suara-suara baru kini berbicara tentang kesatuan, tentang akar, dan tentang rumah. Mungkin, untuk pertama kalinya sejak Reformasi, dunia Protestan dan Katolik melihat satu titik temu bukan hanya dalam teologi, tetapi dalam pribadi.

Paus Leo XIV adalah pengingat bahwa meskipun sejarah bisa terluka, rahmat Tuhan tetap bekerja secara perlahan dan penuh harapan.","",""

For the disagreements against this motion, MBG mainly supplements, and not replaces parental roles. Most parents still want to provide for their kids and see school meals as support, not substitution. In many countries with school feeding programs (e.g., Finland, Japan), parents remain active contributors to family welfare. But this come down to the parental culture that existed in there. Supposedly If food is sourced locally, MBG can stimulate the agricultural sector and create jobs, encouraging productivity rather than laziness (though this one is a mixed result). But this is where the next side of the coin comes in. In some communities, providing for one’s family is a cultural value. MBG might unintentionally undermine that sense of duty. Some irresponsible parents may even divert funds they would’ve used for food to non-essential spending (and oh boi, do we knew some of them do exist). If expanded too far without conditions, MBG could lead to a mindset of overreliance on government programs, reducing motivation to work or plan financially.","",""

 Maybe it is a sense of being alienated in front of your supposed-to-know people. 

 People are supposed to know your point better than a stranger would in debate, but the occassion--you often being on the 'public enemy' side--makes them can't help but being judgemental towards you as the debate goes on. The longer it becomes, the more you feel they seem like a different people than what you expected of them.  At that point, no amount of prediction or assumption you make may be convincing to them anymre. All is lost, you don't know them anymore. your soul is exhausted, and you just be done with it.

Senator Joko Widodo (Jokowi) (D-Ohio)

Party Affiliation: Centrist Democrat, with a strong focus on economic development and infrastructure. Ohio's industrial base and need for revitalization would suit him.
Committee Assignment: Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Appropriations Committee.
Debate Style: Direct, practical, and results-oriented. He would cut through ideological rhetoric to focus on the tangible benefits of the bill: new jobs, improved infrastructure, and economic growth for struggling regions. He'd emphasize the need for efficient government spending and accountability, pushing for specific projects and investments that can deliver immediate impact. He would be a champion of the ""American worker"" and ""Made in America"" initiatives within the energy transition.
Key Argument: ""Mr. President, the people of Ohio, and across this great nation, want action. They want good jobs, clean energy that powers their homes, and infrastructure that works. This bill, if done right, can deliver on those promises. Let's not get bogged down in endless talk. Let's focus on building, innovating, and creating a prosperous future for every American family. My focus will be on ensuring this bill translates directly into tangible benefits for the American worker.""","",""

-Indonesia fucked up early when Hatta's proposal for federalism was rejected by a then power hungry Soekarno
-Soekarno was a socialist
-Soeharto took advantage (instead of orchestrating) of the G30SPKI chaos to seize power and had the army overthrew the government
-Indonesia is set up to be a socialist country only to deviate heavily into crony capitalism
-Papua's ""liberation"" was straight up military occupation during the time
-Indonesian military committed terrorist action against Malaysia and Singapore in the 1960s
-Indonesia was on the right track of building its own products in the 1990s only to be fucked
-Indonesia was never colonized for 350 years. VOC was dealing businesses with the natives from 1602 to 1800s often unfairly or sometimes the local kingdoms got high on Dutch money and imposed unfair treaties. Direct Dutch colonial rule was only 142 years. Some places weren't even fully under Dutch control, or had uneven colonial rule or were even uplifted by the Dutch. Full colonial control was only around parts of Sumatra, full on Java and parts of South Sulawesi. 
-Ali Baba economy affirmative action policy only intensified the divide between Indonesians and Chinese Indonesians
-Soeharto fucked up big time taking IMF help despite Mahathir's warnings
-SBY's rule is the most democratic of Indonesia's period, but he lowkey ruined Indonesia by fully embracing neolib market economy
-We did a lot of shady shit in Timor Timur
-There was a time when Indonesia was so unstable, Habibie and Gusdur almost fell to a military coup de tat.
-Amien Rais was an asshole
-Boediono was lowkey the villain of SBY's second term
-Jokowi was a puppet during the first term, cut strings on the second half of the second term cause apparently Andika Perkasa's appointment of Panglima TNI pissed him off","",""

Peter Coyote merenungkan tiga mentor utama yang membentuk hidupnya. Yang pertama adalah Sue Howard-Nelson, seorang wanita muda Afrika-Amerika yang merawatnya setelah ibunya mengalami gangguan jiwa. Tumbuh dalam keluarga yang kaya tetapi tidak memiliki emosi yang kuat, Sue dan komunitasnya mengajarinya tentang keadilan, kejujuran, realitas menjadi orang kulit putih, dan juga menumbuhkan kecintaannya pada musik dan tari. Mentor keduanya adalah penyair Gary Snyder, seorang sarjana Buddhisme Zen, yang menjadi contoh bagaimana memadukan prinsip-prinsip Buddhis ke dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Yang ketiga adalah perancang busana Italia Nino Cerruti, yang mewujudkan keanggunan, integritas, dan menunjukkan kepada Coyote cara bernavigasi dalam lingkungan elit tanpa mengorbankan nilai-nilainya. Setiap mentor sangat memengaruhi rasa etika, spiritualitas, dan tujuannya.","",""

So what part of Indonesia Economy was exactly ruined?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3.  What did  Boediono  exactly do to be named as a lowkey villain?                                                                                4. Was what Boediono did justified for both during that time and today's era?","",""

Internally, Indonesia was recovering from the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, and there was a push towards economic reform to stabilize the economy and attract foreign investment, thus why neo-lib was adopted. Externally, global trends favored liberalization and market-oriented reforms which if SBY choose the neo-lib approach, he will gain good fabors with the global markets theoretically for economic growth.
2. SBY was argued by critics to aim for economic growth at the cost environments and dependecy to foreign capitals. It can also potentially increase income disparities and weakened labor protections since neo-liberal policies tend to ignored these issues in favor for economic growth and results.
3. Boediono was basically SBY's vice president, later on turning to Minister of Finance during the second term of SBY. Now, the second term was where he started to be labelled as ""villain"" due to his economic policies. His policies mainly focus on fiscal discipline and efforts to manage Indonesia's debt and budget deficit, but it costed social welfare programs and economic sectors reliant on government support due to some budget cuts (basically he tried to save the economy from deficits by cutting a lot of funds or subsidies).
4. It depends. On one hand, he did succeed in cutting a lot of budgets to save up costs while reducing deficits. On the other hand, he did can be argued to have certain social costs and long-term impacts. I would be neutral to it and sees it as nothing more but pro and cons of implementing certain approach at the cost of other sectors.","",""

Diakonis itu bersifat vertikal, makanya berfokus sama aspek waktu dan urutan kronologis serta sebab-akibat. Makanya diakonis itu berfokus sama perubahan waktu.

Contoh: Sumpah Pemuda tahun 1928 diceritakan lewat latar belakang. Dari event event prequel sampai sequelnya seperti apa, dll.

Sinkronis itu bersifat horizontal, jadi fokusnya bukan sama waktu, tapi meluas dalam aspek keruangan yang mendalam dalam satu event. Basically adding more details to such events.

Contoh:
Sejarah kerajaan di Jawa, tapi yang difokuskan itu dari birokrasinya, strukturnya, hubungan masyarakat dengan pemerintah, dll.","",""

My life long passion has been to see Indonesia grow as an industrious country and the issue of industrializing Indonesia has been my core drive. Indonesia is capable of so much more than what we are today, and its desire to be treated as an equal partner has always been a point of struggle in 80 years of our history. Being in politics and governance, I can begin to sense a pattern that hampers our industrialization. Indonesia's bureaucracy needs to be made efficient, streamlined and sterilized from factional politics and interest groups. The administration, which entails laws, bureaucracy, and policy must be insulated from the politics of Indonesia, and its continued exposure to politics in Indonesia is harming the pace of our industrialization. From there, I want to build a build a blueprint for an industrial Indonesia, not as an export-growth manufacturing as many people want us to copy from Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam, but as a resource-powered industrial exporter. Our comparative edge is different, Indonesia must acknowledge that cheap labor is no longer abundant in Indonesia due to minimum wages. Indonesia must leverage its natural resources and begin supplying the world with finished products instead of just raw resources. This path forces the right investments: STEM and TVET at scale, metrology and testing labs, reliable industrial power and ports, export courts with 90 day case disposal, and a supplier development engine that graduates Indonesian SMEs to Tier 2 quality, which has been an ongoing struggle for Indonesia to climatize. It also demands a civil service to answer to output metrics and not political churn.","",""

How?

Because the way teachers are trained in Aus (either undergrad or postgrad) is very different. Teacher training in Western countries are not overly reliant on workbooks, sheets, drill tests/exams. We have to lead students to inquire.

We also have strict CPD points to maintain to keep our teaching registration and we get observed by a principal every semester to ensure that the quality is upheld.

There’s pros/cons to this too. 
In math teaching, I found that Western style of conceptual teaching means kids take too long to even remember what 3x5 is because they’re overly reliant on skip counting or other mental models. It’s widely known in math pedagogy that kids need to remember basic addition, subtraction, multiplication and division really quickly so that they can reduce cognitive load when solving for tougher math questions in later years.

I could go on and on about educational pedagogy.","",""

Mengapa Bahasa Belanda Tak Berkembang di Indonesia?
Sekolah Belanda di Surabaya, circa 1920. FOTO/Istimewa
tirto.id - Baterai, bioskop, debat, bandit, rekening, knalpot, gratis, jas, kabinet, kanker, sigaret, hingga wortel. Kata-kata ini berseliweran dalam percakapan berbahasa Indonesia sehari-hari. Mereka semua berasal dari bahasa Belanda, warisan dari tiga abad kolonialisme.

Meski jejak kosakatanya masih ada, obrolan sepenuhnya berbahasa Belanda nyaris tak terdengar di era modern. Itulah paradoks yang membedakan Hindia Belanda dari imperium kolonial lain.

Di India, Filipina, atau Indocina, bahasa penjajah bertahan sebagai bahasa elit dan administrasi. Di Indonesia, bahasa Belanda menguap, hanya menyisakan serpihan.

Hal itu karena pemerintah kolonial Belanda memang tak berniat menyebarkan bahasanya. Mereka memilih segregasi bahasa sebagai strategi kekuasaan. Bahasa Belanda dijadikan tembok pemisah, bukan jembatan.

Alih-alih memperkuat dominasi, ia secara tak langsung memberi ruang bagi bahasa Melayu untuk tumbuh sebagai pengikat antar-etnis. Awalnya bahasa dagang,Melayu pelan-pelan menjelma jadi alat perjuangan..","",""

Kegagalan Politik Bahasa Kolonial
Dominasi Belanda di Hindia tidak pernah disertai ambisi menyebarkan bahasanya. Berbeda dari imperium lain yang menjadikan bahasa sebagai alat asimilasi, Belanda justru memakainya untuk memisahkan.

Sejak era VOC, kolonialisme Belanda berpusat pada eksploitasi ekonomi, bukan integrasi budaya. Menyebarkan bahasa Belanda dianggap tidak efisien. Menurut Joss Wibisono, alasannya adalah lebih murah mewajibkan pegawai VOC belajar bahasa Melayu ketimbang mengajarkan bahasa Belanda kepada jutaan penduduk pribumi.

Strategi tersebut berlanjut ketika VOC bangkrut pada akhir abad ke-18, lalu kekuasaan di tanah Hindia diambil alih oleh Kerajaan Belanda, tentu saja dengan melanjutkan politik bahasa yang sama. Berbeda dari koloni lain yang memiliki bahasa pengantar, Belanda tidak merasa perlu memperkenalkan bahasanya.

Bahasa Belanda hanya tersedia bagi segelintir elit: pejabat Eropa, pengusaha, dan priyayi yang diizinkan masuk lingkaran kekuasaan. Bagi mereka, bahasa itu adalah tiket menuju modernitas versi kolonial.

Dengan membatasi akses, Belanda mencegah masuknya gagasan-gagasan Barat, seperti kesetaraan dan hak asasi manusia. Ini bagian dari pola pikir kolonial yang memandang pribumi sebagai entitas lebih rendah, yang harus ""dijaga"" agar tetap di bawah.

Pendidikan pun dirancang untuk memperkuat pemisahan ini. Sekolah desa hanya mengajarkan baca-tulis dasar berbahasa lokal atau bahasa Melayu rendah (Melayu pasar), yang penting cukup untuk mencetak tenaga kerja murah.

Adapun sekolah elite, seperti Europese Lagere School (ELS) dan Hollands-Inlandsche School (HIS), memakai bahasa Belanda dan bahasa Melayu tinggi. Dua bahasa itulah yang menjadi satu-satunya jalan menuju pendidikan tinggi dan posisi birokrasi. Tapi, aksesnya sangat terbatas. Hingga tahun 1850, dari 3.500 murid yang bersekolah di ELS, hanya 50 murid yang berasal dari kalangan elite pribumi.

Menariknya, ada beberapa sekolah pribumi yang memiliki guru Belanda dan menggunakan bahasa Belanda dalam pengantarnya, misalnya Sekolah Kartini di berbagai daerah.","",""

“Sekolah Kartini dapat menghancurkan tembok pemisah yang mereka [Dutch] pasang antara pengajar Belanda dengan anak-anak inlandsche. Sekolah Kartini adalah bertujuan untuk mengajarkan putri Indonesia mencapai apa yang mereka perlukan,” demikian tertulis dalam laporan beberapa staf pengajar di Sekolah Kartini Buitenzorg.

Menurut H.M.J Maier (1993), berdasarkan sensus pada 1930, hanya 0,3 persen pribumi yang bisa menulis dalam bahasa Belanda. Itu pun hanya surat pendek sederhana.

Sementara para elite berdiskusi dalam bahasa penjajah, rakyat tetap memakai bahasa lokal dan Melayu pasar. Bahasa terakhir disebut, yang awalnya hanya alat komunikasi praktis, pelan-pelan menjadi benang pengikat antar-etnis. Kebijakan kolonial yang membatasi penggunaan bahasa Melayu justru membuatnya makin tajam sebagai senjata utama gerakan nasionalis.

Dalam “Politik Bahasa pada Masa Hindia Belanda” (1999), Kees Groeneboer menilai, faktor pasif lainnya yang menyebabkan bahasa Belanda tidak berkembang ialah kemampuan daya pikir pribumi yang terbatas saat itu.

Groeneboer mencontohkan fenomena di Pulau Nias yang sempat mewacanakan pemberlakuan bahasa Belanda sebagai bahasa pengantar dan pergaulan, terutama untuk membantu penyebaran agama Kristen. Namun, itu akhirnya ditolak karena masyarakat ragu akan hasilnya.

“Pada akhir 1858 diputuskan untuk memberikan pendidikan di Nias dengan bahasa Melayu sebagai bahasa pengantar, tidak dengan bahasa Belanda,” sambung Groeneboer.

Warsa 1865, pendidikan dasar di sekolah-sekolah pribumi sudah menggunakan bahasa daerah sebagai pengantarnya, yakni Melayu, Jawa, Sunda, Madura, dan Batak-Mandailing. Ia kemudian disusul oleh bahasa daerah lainnya antara tahun 1877-1900, seperti Bawean, Bugis, Dayak, Gorontalo, Makasar, Nias, Sangir, dan Tumbulu.

Keputusan menggunakan bahasa daerah ataupun Melayu diperkuat oleh Dekrit Kerajaan Belanda pada 30 Mei 1868 No.37. Kebijakan itu mengatur mengenai pendidikan bagi pribumi di Hindia Belanda.

“Akan tetapi, ketentuan dalam keputusan tahun 1868, yang menyatakan bahwa apabila bahasa daerah tidak dapat digunakan untuk pendidikan, bahasa lain yang dipahami oleh penduduk di wilayah tempat sekolah itu berada dapat digunakan, telah digantikan oleh ketentuan yang lebih fasih, yang menetapkan bahwa dalam kasus tersebut pengajaran harus diberikan dalam bahasa Melayu,” tulis Laporan Kolonial (Koloniaal Verslag) tahun 1871.

Ketakutan kolonial terhadap pendidikan setara tecermin dalam pernyataan para pejabat. Meski ada beberapa suara optimistis, misalnya Gubernur Jenderal A.W.F. Idenburg yang mendukung perluasan pendidikan, mayoritas pejabat menolak. Begitu juga orang tua Eropa yang khawatir anaknya sekelas dengan pribumi. Ketakutan itu bukan soal pendidikan, tapi soal kontrol. Belanda tahu, memberi akses bahasa berarti memberi alat melawan.

Pada akhirnya, strategi eksklusifnya memang berhasil menjaga hierarki, tapi gagal mencegah perlawanan. Dengan menolak menjadikan bahasa Belanda sebagai pemersatu, dan membiarkan bahasa Melayu tetap hidup, mereka justru memperkuat medium yang akan menyatukan suara-suara perlawanan","",""

Kebangkitan Bahasa Melayu sebagai Senjata Politik
Memasuki abad ke-20, arah politik Hindia Belanda mulai berubah. Sebuah lembaga penerbitan didirikan pada 1917. Namanya Kantoor voor de Volkslectuur, yang di kemudian hari dikenal sebagai Balai Pustaka. Tujuannya ialah mengontrol penyebaran informasi dan tulisan. Bersamaan dengan itu, suara perlawanan yang sebelumnya sunyi dan pasif mulai lantang.

Kaum nasionalis, yang lahir dari rahim Politik Etis, melihat bahasa Melayu bukan lagi sekadar alat komunikasi, melainkan senjata untuk membentuk identitas dan menyebarkan gagasan. Bahasa tersebut menjadi medium perlawanan, dari ruang sidang Volksraad (Dewan Rakyat) hingga halaman surat kabar.

Volksraad, yang berdiri pada 18 Mei 1918 di Batavia, menetapkan bahasa Belanda sebagai bahasa resmi. Namun, hal itu membuat banyak anggota pribumi kesulitan menyampaikan pikiran mereka. Salah satu anggota Volksraad, Pangeran Aria Achmad Djajadiningrat, mengusulkan agar bahasa Melayu diizinkan.

“Memang, belajar bahasa Belanda tidak mudah bagi kami penduduk asli, yang pertama kali memiliki kesempatan untuk melakukannya pada usia yang relatif terlambat,” ujarnya, sebagaimana dikutip dari Historiek.

Pihak Belanda menolak usulan itu, salah satunya disampaikan oleh Pieter Bergmeijer. Tapi, resistansi itu menunjukkan ketakutan yang lebih dalam bahwa bahasa Melayu bisa menjadi saluran aspirasi politik dan semangat kemerdekaan. Benar saja, lambat laun penggunaan bahasa Melayu di Volksraad berubah menjadi bentuk pembangkangan.

Pada Agustus 1939, M. H. Thamrin, Soetardjo, dan Soekawati, mengajukan mosi di Volksraad yang mengusulkan penggunaan istilah Indonesia, Indonesier, dan Indonesisch sebagai pengganti Nederlandsch-Indië, Inlander, dan Inlandsch. Usulan itu baru direspons setahun kemudian, Agustus 1940, dan ujungnya sama: ditolak.

Di luar Volksraad, perang suara berkecamuk di surat kabar berbahasa Melayu. Menurut Hilman Farid dalam Perang Suara: Bahasa dan Politik Pergerakan (2024), surat kabar menjadi medan pertempuran utama bagi gagasan-gagasan berbahasa Melayu.

Kapitalisme cetak, lanjut Hilman, membuka ruang publik baru, tempat gagasan-gagasan nasionalis menyebar lewat tulisan oleh bumiputra. Di sinilah kosakata politik baru dibentuk. Kata bangsa tak lagi merujuk pada etnis, tapi pada nasion yang melampaui batas suku; kemajuan tak lagi milik penjajah, tapi hak yang harus diperjuangkan; dan merdeka berubah dari kebebasan pribadi menjadi cita-cita kolektif, yakni kemerdekaan nasional.

Surat kabar perlawanan, seperti Medan Prijaji dan De Expres, menjadi corong suara rakyat. Mereka menyampaikan berita, keluhan, kritik, dan harapan. Sejak itu, pembaca mulai melihat dirinya sebagai bagian dari satu kesatuan: bukan lagi Jawa, Sunda, atau Melayu.

Sebelum merdeka secara politik, para bapak bangsa menganggap bahwa rakyat terlebih dahulu harus mampu membayangkan dirinya sebagai bangsa. Dan, bahasa Melayu adalah alat untuk membentuk bayangan itu, bukan bahasa Belanda bahasa kolonial.","",""

Transisi Linguistik
Puncak pembentukan identitas kolektif Indonesia terjadi pada Kongres Pemuda II di Batavia, 27-28 Oktober 1928. Di sana, organisasi-organisasi pemuda, yang sebelumnya terikat pada identitas kedaerahan, bersatu dalam satu visi kebangsaan. Di akhir kongres, lahirlah Sumpah Pemuda.

Butir ikrar ketiga mengenai penggunaan bahasa Indonesia lahir dari diskusi panjang, terutama berkat usulan Mohammad Tabrani yang ""melahirkan"" bahasa Indonesia, alih-alih bahasa Melayu.

“Bangsa dan pembatja kita sekalian! Bangsa Indonesia beloem ada. Terbitkanlah bangsa Indonesia itoe. Bahasa Indonesia belum ada. Terbitkanlah bahasa Indonesia itoe,” tulis Tabrani dalam sebuah esai.

Tabrani secara politis ingin memutus bahasa dari akar etnis dan menjadikannya milik bersama. Itulah proklamasi linguistik yang mendahului kemerdekaan politik.

Pemerintah kolonial menyadari ancaman ini. Seturut Anton M. Moeliono dalam buku The Earliest Stage of Language Planning: “The First Congress” Phenomenon (1993:130), Belanda melarang pelajaran bahasa Melayu di sekolah-sekolah di Jawa pada 1930 dan seluruh wilayah Nusantara pada 1932. Namun, tekanan itu justru memperkuat posisi bahasa Indonesia sebagai simbol perlawanan dan pemersatu.

Momen yang paling mempercepat transformasi ini justru datang dari pendudukan Jepang antara 1942–1945. Merujuk Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana dalam Indonesian Language and Literature: Two Essays (1962), Jepang melarang total penggunaan bahasa Belanda di ruang publik untuk tujuan apa pun.

Meski berniat menggantinya dengan bahasa Jepang, rencana itu tak realistis. Maka kekosongan itu diisi oleh satu-satunya bahasa yang sudah menjangkau seluruh wilayah: bahasa Indonesia.

Sejak itu, untuk pertama kalinya, bahasa Indonesia digunakan secara resmi di semua ranah, mulai surat kabar, radio, dokumen pemerintahan, hingga pendidikan dari tingkat dasar sampai perguruan tinggi. Komisi-komisi bahasa dibentuk untuk menerjemahkan istilah teknis dan administratif. Dalam waktu singkat, kosakata berkembang pesat dan masyarakat mengalami imersi total.

Saat Sukarno dan Hatta membacakan teks proklamasi pada 17 Agustus 1945, mereka memilih bahasa Indonesia—bukan bahasa Jawa, bukan bahasa Belanda. Pilihan ini tak lagi diperdebatkan. Pasal 36 UUD 1945 mengukuhkannya: “Bahasa Negara ialah Bahasa Indonesia”.

Example - Give examples or analogies to illustrate your point
If you're presenting arguments to support a point, aim for 3 arguments.

3. Body 2
PEE again, but go deeper or other side of the coin.
If you're presenting opposing arguments to your point, aim for 2 arguments.

4. Conclusion
Summarize all main arguments, refer back to the ""overall view"" in the introduction, but now add some details from your arguments.

**Note:** There's no strict rule on how many ""Body"" paragraphs you need to have, just make sure you have at least 2 paragraphs minimum (for pro & contra arguments)","",""

I just read a news piece on how a certain minister will be sending sports equipment for survivors of the Sumatra disaster. Any sane and intellectually-abled person would recognise this is ridiculous, but I'd like to add how this could be detrimental

When it comes to emergencies and natural disasters, the right to adequate and safe food must be reaffirmed, no matter how difficult it is to be upheld by the government. Especially during natural disasters, food security is often a logistical nightmare, and so oftentimes only the bare minimum of food can be sent to the affected population. Even then in terms of quality and quantity it's barely enough, hygiene is often not maintained, and therefore risks of malnutrition, morbidity and even mortality will increase

When sports equipment are sent, that's precious cargo space that could be used for food and hygiene products. Furthermore, promoting *exercise* during a crisis in a condition where everyone is preserving energy to survive and health responders are in shambles trying to make sure everyone eats enough is unimaginably dense","","⭐ (6)"

Hedonia dan Eudiamonia

Mengapa Kita Sering Merasa Hampa Meski Sudah Bersenang-senang? Menggali Makna Kebahagiaan Menurut Aristoteles
Elya Rafanani

Dalam Artikel Ini
Kebahagiaan menurut Aristoteles adalah sebuah aktivitas jiwa yang selaras dengan kebajikan (arete) untuk mencapai potensi terbaik manusia—sebuah kondisi paripurna yang ia sebut sebagai Eudaimonia—bukan sekadar perasaan senang sesaat atau kepuasan emosional yang datang dan pergi.

Pernahkah kamu merasakan kehampaan yang aneh justru setelah menghabiskan akhir pekan yang “seru”? Kamu baru saja pulang dari kafe hits di Jakarta Selatan, perutmu kenyang oleh makanan enak, dan galeri ponselmu penuh dengan foto-foto estetik yang siap tayang di Instagram. Teman-temanmu tertawa, musik berdentum keras, dan untuk beberapa jam, beban pekerjaan seolah hilang.

Akan tetapi, begitu kamu merebahkan tubuh di kasur pada pukul dua pagi, perasaan itu datang. Sebuah lubang hitam di dada. Kamu menatap langit-langit kamar dan bertanya, “Kenapa aku masih merasa kosong? Padahal aku sudah bersenang-senang.”

Rasa gelisah ini sering kali menghantui anak muda zaman sekarang. Kita bekerja keras bagai kuda untuk membeli kesenangan. Mengejar promosi, memburu gadget terbaru, dan menabung untuk liburan ke luar negeri. Kita mengira rumus hidup itu sederhana: Kesenangan sama dengan Kebahagiaan.

Namun, jika rumus itu benar, mengapa tingkat depresi justru meroket di kalangan generasi yang memiliki akses hiburan tanpa batas ini?

Rupanya, kita mungkin telah salah mendefinisikan tujuan hidup. Kita tersesat dalam labirin hedonisme yang semu. Untuk menemukan jalan keluar dari krisis makna ini, kita perlu memutar waktu mundur ke Yunani Kuno dan duduk mendengarkan kuliah dari seorang guru besar bernama Aristoteles.

Siapa Sebenarnya Aristoteles? Sang Guru yang Membumi
Sebelum menyelami pemikirannya, mari kita berkenalan dulu dengan sosoknya. Berbeda dengan gurunya, Plato, yang gemar menunjuk ke langit dan berbicara tentang dunia ide yang abstrak, Aristoteles adalah sosok yang menunjuk ke bumi. Ia adalah seorang pengamat ulung, ilmuwan biologi, logika, dan etika yang sangat pragmatis.

Lahir di Stagira pada tahun 384 SM, ia pernah menjadi guru privat bagi Alexander Agung. Bayangkan betapa hebatnya wawasan orang ini hingga ia mendidik seorang penakluk dunia. Namun, hal yang membuat Aristoteles istimewa bukanlah koneksi kerajaannya, melainkan caranya memandang dunia.

Ia terobsesi pada “fungsi” dan “tujuan”. Ia mengamati segala sesuatu, mulai dari gerak bintang, perilaku hewan laut, hingga konstitusi politik berbagai negara kota. Ia ingin tahu bagaimana segala sesuatu bekerja dan, yang lebih penting, untuk apa sesuatu itu ada.

Maka dari itu, ketika ia berbicara tentang manusia, ia tidak sedang berpuisi. Ia sedang melakukan analisis biologis dan logis. Ia ingin menjawab pertanyaan paling fundamental: Apa fungsi manusia di dunia ini? Dan bagaimana manusia bisa menjalani “hidup yang baik”?

Pemikirannya tentang kebahagiaan tertuang dalam karya legendarisnya, Nicomachean Ethics. Buku ini bukanlah kitab suci yang berisi perintah dogmatis, melainkan sebuah panduan praktis untuk merawat jiwa. Aristoteles tidak menyuruhmu membuang hartamu dan hidup di gua. Sebaliknya, ia mengajarkan cara mengelola hasrat, akal, dan tindakan agar hidupmu mekar sepenuhnya.","",""

Eudaimonia: Ketika “Senang” Saja Tidak Cukup
Gagasan inti Aristoteles yang paling relevan untuk mengobati kegelisahan manusia modern berpusat pada satu kata: Eudaimonia.

Banyak penerjemah mengartikan kata ini sebagai “kebahagiaan” (happiness). Sayangnya, terjemahan ini sering menimbulkan salah kaprah. Dalam bahasa Indonesia modern, “bahagia” sering kita samakan dengan emosi positif sesaat, seperti rasa senang saat makan es krim atau euforia saat tim bola favorit menang.

Akan tetapi, Aristoteles menolak keras definisi tersebut. Baginya, itu adalah Hedonia (kesenangan), bukan Eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia lebih tepat kita artikan sebagai “pengembangan diri yang paripurna” atau flourishing. Bayangkan sebuah tanaman mawar. Kapan kita bisa menyebut mawar itu “bahagia” atau “sukses”? Tentu bukan saat mawar itu “tersenyum”, melainkan saat ia tumbuh subur, akarnya kuat, batangnya kokoh, dan bunganya mekar sempurna sesuai dengan potensi alaminya.

Begitu pula dengan manusia.

Aristoteles berargumen dengan konsep Teleologi (tujuan). Segala sesuatu punya fungsi (ergon). Fungsi pisau adalah memotong. Pisau yang “baik” atau “bahagia” adalah pisau yang tajam dan bisa memotong dengan sempurna. Jika pisau itu tumpul, meskipun gagangnya terbuat dari emas berlian, itu adalah pisau yang buruk.

Lantas, apa fungsi manusia?

Kita tidak hidup sekadar untuk tumbuh (tumbuhan juga tumbuh). Kita tidak hidup sekadar untuk merasakan sensasi (hewan juga punya indra). Fungsi unik manusia, menurut Aristoteles, adalah menggunakan akal budi (logos) atau rasionalitas.

Oleh karena itu, kebahagiaan menurut Aristoteles terjadi ketika kita hidup sesuai dengan fungsi nalar kita secara maksimal dan bajik. Kebahagiaan bukanlah sebuah perasaan yang pasif, melainkan sebuah aktivitas. Kamu tidak “menjadi” bahagia; kamu “melakukan” kebahagiaan.","",""
"766280136332410920","ekast237707","2026-02-08T07:45:45.1240000+00:00",". 
Jalan Tengah Emas: Seni Menyeimbangkan Hidup
Selanjutnya, Aristoteles menawarkan panduan teknis untuk mencapai Eudaimonia, yaitu melalui konsep The Golden Mean (Jalan Tengah Emas).

Ia percaya bahwa kebajikan (virtue) selalu terletak di antara dua titik ekstrem: kelebihan (ekses) dan kekurangan (defisiensi). Keduanya adalah keburukan.

Mari kita ambil contoh konkret dalam kehidupan sehari-hari anak muda Indonesia:

Keberanian: Jika kamu tidak punya rasa takut sama sekali, kamu bukan pemberani, melainkan “nekat” (rash). Kamu akan mati konyol. Sebaliknya, jika kamu terlalu takut mengambil risiko, kamu adalah “pengecut”. Keberanian sejati ada di tengah-tengah: kamu tahu rasa takut, tetapi kamu tetap bertindak dengan perhitungan matang.

Kedermawanan: Jika kamu memberikan semua uang gajimu sampai kamu sendiri kelaparan, itu bukan baik, melainkan “boros” dan tidak bertanggung jawab. Sebaliknya, jika kamu tidak mau berbagi sepeser pun, kamu “kikir”. Jalan tengahnya adalah memberi sesuai kemampuan dan pada orang yang tepat.

Ambisi: Di era hustle culture, kita sering terjebak pada kerja berlebihan (burnout). Aristoteles akan menyebut ini sebagai ekses yang merusak jiwa. Namun, menjadi “kaum rebahan” yang malas juga merupakan defisiensi. Hidup yang baik adalah menyeimbangkan ambisi dengan istirahat yang berkualitas.

Konsep ini mengajarkan kita bahwa menjadi orang baik itu bukan soal menjadi ekstrem. Menjadi fanatik (dalam agama, politik, atau diet) justru menjauhkan kita dari kebajikan.

Oleh karena itu, Aristoteles mengajak kita untuk terus-menerus melatih penilaian situasi. Tidak ada rumus baku. Kamu harus menggunakan nalarmu untuk menentukan di mana titik tengah itu berada dalam setiap situasi yang berbeda. Ini membutuhkan latihan seumur hidup.

Persahabatan: Kita Tidak Bisa Bahagia Sendirian
Selain nalar, Aristoteles juga menekankan pentingnya persahabatan (Philia). Ia bahkan mendedikasikan porsi besar dalam bukunya untuk membahas ini. Menurutnya, tidak ada orang yang bisa mencapai Eudaimonia dalam isolasi.

Namun, ia membedakan persahabatan menjadi tiga jenis:

Persahabatan Guna (Utility): Kamu berteman karena saling menguntungkan (misalnya, teman bisnis atau teman yang punya mobil).

Persahabatan Nikmat (Pleasure): Kamu berteman karena dia asyik diajak nongkrong atau punya hobi sama.

Persahabatan Kebajikan (Virtue): Kamu berteman karena kalian saling mengagumi karakter satu sama lain dan saling mendorong untuk menjadi orang yang lebih baik.

Masalah kita hari ini adalah kita memiliki terlalu banyak teman tipe 1 dan 2, tetapi sangat miskin teman tipe 3. Media sosial memfasilitasi koneksi yang dangkal. Kita punya ribuan pengikut, tetapi saat kita sedang hancur, kita bingung harus menelepon siapa.

Aristoteles mengingatkan bahwa persahabatan sejati (tipe 3) memerlukan waktu, kepercayaan, dan kebersamaan yang nyata. Persahabatan ini langka, namun tanpanya, hidup yang baik mustahil terwujud.","",""

Sisi Gelap Aristoteles: Sebuah Kritik Jujur
Meskipun pemikirannya brilian, kita tidak boleh memuja Aristoteles secara buta. Sebagai penulis yang objektif, kita harus mengakui bahwa pandangannya memiliki cacat besar jika kita lihat dari kacamata modern.

Pertama, Aristoteles memiliki pandangan yang sangat elitis. Ia percaya bahwa Eudaimonia membutuhkan dukungan faktor eksternal. Menurutnya, sulit bagi seseorang untuk bahagia jika ia sangat miskin, berwajah sangat buruk, atau tidak punya teman. Ia bahkan menganggap budak dan wanita tidak memiliki kapasitas nalar yang cukup untuk mencapai kebajikan tertinggi.

Tentu saja, pandangan ini sangat bias dan seksis. Ia adalah produk dari zamannya, seorang pria aristokrat Yunani yang hidup dalam masyarakat perbudakan.

Selain itu, konsepnya tentang “tujuan hidup” (telos) terasa agak kaku bagi sebagian orang modern. Kaum eksistensialis seperti Sartre akan menolak gagasan bahwa manusia lahir dengan “fungsi” bawaan seperti pisau. Bagi Sartre, kita bebas menciptakan fungsi kita sendiri.

Akan tetapi, kritik-kritik ini tidak serta-merta membatalkan relevansi etikanya. Kita bisa membuang pandangan sosialnya yang usang, namun tetap mengambil inti ajarannya tentang pengembangan karakter dan keseimbangan hidup.

Membangun “Habitus” Baru
Lantas, bagaimana kita bisa menerapkan filsafat Aristoteles ini besok pagi? Apakah kita harus membaca buku tebal berbahasa Yunani?

Tidak perlu. Kuncinya ada pada kata “Kebiasaan” atau Habitus.

Aristoteles pernah berkata (atau lebih tepatnya, Will Durant menyimpulkan pemikiran Aristoteles): “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” (Kita adalah apa yang kita lakukan berulang-ulang. Maka, keunggulan bukanlah sebuah tindakan, melainkan kebiasaan).

Jika kamu merasa hidupmu berantakan, jangan menunggu motivasi besar datang dari langit. Jangan menunggu “momen pencerahan” yang dramatis.

Mulailah dengan tindakan kecil. Jika kamu ingin menjadi penulis, menulislah satu paragraf setiap hari. Jangan menunggu mood. Jika kamu ingin menjadi orang yang sabar, berlatihlah menahan amarah saat terjebak macet besok pagi. Jika kamu ingin bahagia, berhentilah mengejar kesenangan pasif (menonton, membeli, memakan). Mulailah melakukan aktivitas aktif yang menantang nalarmu dan memperkaya jiwamu.

Kamu membentuk karaktermu seperti seorang pemahat membentuk patung: sedikit demi sedikit, pukulan demi pukulan, hari demi hari.

Saat kamu merasa malas berolahraga, ingatlah konsep Eudaimonia. Kamu berolahraga bukan sekadar supaya terlihat bagus di cermin (itu hedonia atau vanitas), melainkan karena kamu sedang merawat tubuhmu agar bisa berfungsi optimal sebagai manusia. Pergeseran pola pikir dari “penampilan” ke “fungsi” ini akan membuat bebanmu terasa lebih ringan.

Akibatnya, kebahagiaan tidak lagi menjadi sesuatu yang kamu kejar-kejar di masa depan. Kebahagiaan menjadi efek samping yang muncul secara alami ketika kamu sibuk menjalani hidup yang bajik dan bermakna hari ini.

Penutup
Dunia modern terus membombardir kita dengan pesan bahwa kebahagiaan bisa kita beli. Iklan-iklan menyuruh kita untuk memanjakan diri, membeli kenyamanan, dan menghindari segala bentuk kesulitan.

Namun, Aristoteles datang melintasi ribuan tahun untuk membisikkan kebenaran yang berbeda. Ia memberitahu kita bahwa kebahagiaan bukanlah barang dagangan. Kebahagiaan adalah kerja keras. Kebahagiaan adalah keringat jiwa yang muncul saat kita berusaha menjadi versi terbaik dari diri kita sendiri.","",""

Mungkin hidup yang baik itu memang melelahkan. Kita harus terus berpikir, terus menimbang jalan tengah, dan terus menjaga hubungan persahabatan yang dalam. Akan tetapi, kelelahan itu berbeda dengan kehampaan yang kamu rasakan saat ini. Itu adalah kelelahan yang memuaskan, seperti lelahnya tubuh seorang pendaki yang baru saja mencapai puncak gunung dan melihat matahari terbit.

Jadi, berhentilah bertanya “apa yang bisa membuatku senang hari ini?”. Mulailah bertanya “apa yang bisa aku lakukan hari ini untuk merawat nalar dan karakterku?”. Di sanalah, di tengah aktivitas kebajikan itu, kamu akan menemukan kebahagiaan yang tidak akan hilang begitu saja saat pagi berganti malam.","",""
