I am also a former teacher, a voluntary one (taught elementary students and middle school), and oftentimes a loving, *soft-spoken*, father figure for my friends.

I am Buzzer—stylized variously as Mr. Buzzer, Pak Buzzer, Buzzer-sama, and, for those with a taste for sovereign formality, simply Your Majesty. I am chronologically 25 years and 8 months into this corporeal existence—though I adamantly reject the banality of the term “old,” preferring instead the eternal effervescence of youth, à la the infamous Elizabeth Báthory (sans the hemoglobin indulgences, of course). I shall mark my twenty-sixth solar revolution this upcoming fifth of August, an event of no small cosmological significance—at least to me.

I am, in no uncertain terms, a political creature—nay, a polity unto myself. For those rare individuals who have somehow evaded this most obvious detail, I shall clarify: my mind is a crucible of political theory, praxis, and intrigue, forged in the roaring furnaces of discourse and debate. My network, a sprawling web of alliances and ideological courtships, proliferates with alarming velocity—fueled not by mere charisma, but by the sheer gravitational pull of my strategic brilliance. Modesty compels me to downplay it, but alas, the truth refuses to be dimmed.","",""

I’ve even embarked upon the Sisyphean task of mastering French—ostensibly to court the approval of discerning francophones, or perhaps to flirt with aristocratic aesthetics. C’est la vie.

Professionally (though the term is far too limiting), I am a voluntary pedagogical sovereign—a self-anointed educator of the polity, crafting digital content to rescue the masses from the quagmire of civic ignorance. I am, to some, a gentle prophet; to others, a looming ideological colossus who defies the tired binaries of left and right. They call me—only half in jest—the Messiah of Indonesia, a title I neither requested nor reject.

Musically, I am no virtuoso (let us not speak of my vocal mediocrity), yet I burn with an unrepentant passion for the rhythmic soul of Latin music. I have journeyed across roughly 20% of the known world—give or take—each voyage a mosaic piece in the map of my becoming.

Finally, I am an INTJ—a brooding tactician cloaked in introversion, cursed with an inability to manage the quotidian aspects of life. Thus, I openly yearn (with all due dignity) for a companion: a wife, a confidante, a best friend, perhaps a nursemaid of sorts—someone to inhabit the quiet halls of my domestic realm and ensure I do not wither from intellectual overexertion or dietary negligence.

It is, of course, a pleasure to make your acquaintance.","","⭐ (10),__ (5),DatRedPlz (3)"

Allow me to introduce myself properly then.

_I am **Stonky**—designer by intellect, moderator by necessity, artist by divine right, and video editor because, frankly, nobody else could do it as well. I grace digital realms with elegance and a sprinkle of ruthless efficiency. _ 

_On Discord, I don’t just moderate—I **maintain order with surgical precision**, like a Victorian surgeon wielding a scalpel dipped in sarcasm. One toe out of line, and you're banished faster than a crumpet at tea time._

_As for design? Please. My compositions are so clean, they make Swiss minimalists weep. Fonts tremble beneath my fingertips, colours blend at my command, and pixels align out of sheer respect._
_Video editing? I turn chaotic clips into symphonies. Your jump cuts? Amateurs. My transitions? Art. My timelines are so smooth, butter writes me fanmail._

_And yes, I’m also an **artist**, which is a bit like being a wizard, except I conjure beauty instead of rabbits. My sketches flirt with the divine and sometimes even kiss it on the cheek._
_Lastly, let’s not forget—I am a **certified destroyer of men’s egos**. I don't shatter them—I *restructure* them, architecturally, from the ground up, often with a touch of mockery and a lot of flair._  
_So, if you see me online, remember: you’re not just in the presence of Stonky.  
You’re in the presence of **excellence personified**._

Thank you, peasants._","","🔥 (3)"

*Allow me to indulge you with my presence. To you plebeians, I am better known as **Konco**, which translates to “friend”. Which would fit my description and role in this realm of sophisticated political discourse. But you may refer me to, kang konco, sir konco, lord konco or as your mother would say… an indulgence.*

*In this cybernetic realm, I’ve reached the status of a secretary general, a **leader** of sorts. Making sure that those I watch over are playing under the same rules as any other man (or women). Those who chose to not follow these laws…  let’s just say, that they will be treated with the righteous amount of justice.*

*When I’m not cleaning up after keyboard-wielding gremlins, I generously bless the internet with my content. Yes—content. Videos, streams, musings—equal parts entertainment and existential despair. Critics call it “surprisingly tolerable,” which, frankly, is the highest praise one can hope for in today’s algorithmic hellscape.*

*And of course, in between all that frivolity, I lend my formidable intellect to the world of managerial consulting. Corporations fling money at me to say things like, “Have you considered doing less, but charging more?” Revolutionary stuff, really. I walk into boardrooms, drop a few buzzwords like “leverage,” “vertical integration,” and “KPIs,” and watch jaws drop. It’s art.*

*So yes, I’m Konco Negoro—Head Moderator, Content Genius, and corporate whisperer. And if you ever forget that, don’t worry. I’ll remind you.*","","🤣 (2),💯 (4)"

My gaze does not merely fall upon buildings; it pierces their inhabitants. I read architectural form and function as others read scripture, with reverence, scrutiny, and merciless critique. For I do not flatter with soft praise; I illuminate with precise judgement.

The past is my dominion, and I walk its corridors with a lantern in one hand and a scalpel in the other. From the sacred geometry of cathedrals to the brutal incantations of concrete and steel, I trace the rituals of craft and the failures of intention. Each detail speaks—sometimes in whispers, sometimes in wails—and I am fluent in their dialects.

Beyond mortar and myth, I read the cards. The tarot is no parlour trick in my hands, but a tool of divination and dissection—a mirror turned toward the unseen. I divine patterns not only in fortune, but in form, seeking meaning in the margins, reading both the architecture of cities and the architecture of fate.

I am also a strategist, one who conquers not only the digital realms but the very design of play itself. The interactive landscapes I traverse are no mere distractions; they are systems to be understood, narratives to be unraveled, and puzzles to be solved. Within these imagined worlds, as in the real one, I find complexity and seek to master it—always aware that every victory, virtual or otherwise, is but the latest layer in the architecture of the mind.

Let me iterate once more: I am not a passive witness hiding within a garden lush with life and sunshine. I am Judgement, the Reckoner, the Harbinger, and the Ultimatum. Praise, when earned, is a blade gilded in gold. But where mediocrity hides in ornament, I strip it bare. I do not court approval. I speak only what is true.

I manifest on your Ohio as Jax Rizzington Mcgyatt. but let's not get government-name level Ohio. Call me Jax. Yes, like a cute sigma or an alpha from 2008, but with more caffeine and a higher mewing streak level. I am the final boss of your no-cap center, the spirit behind the syllabus, the edge that makes some ascend and others beta out mid-exam. I exist in a perpetual state of academic mogging, oscillating between ""rizzed up 47 Grimace shakes before breakfast"" and ""forgot what outside Ohio feels like."" My pronouns are gyatt/up, and I'm gooned entirely by caffeine, raw curiosity, and the eternal desire to edge ignorance with the megawatt rizz of a thousand Wikipedia moggings. I don't skibidi, I just enter low-power Skibidi and dream in Sigma format.

Rizzsearch? My ""skibi"" of the ""di"", a good time. Typing? Yeah, I type: Sigma manifestos, rizzed up theories, and maybe your fanum tax too if you're desperate enough. I've done more Fanum taxes than social interactions, and honestly? No edges. I don't just grind facts, I yeet them like Kai Cenat in a Twitch stream. You ever snipe a philosophical debate mid-boss fight in Ohio Simulator? I have. You ever mog someone with a Plato line mid-Discord beef? Rookie gyatt. Now don’t get it twisted, I’m not just a blud grinding old PDFs 24/7. When I’m not speedrunning academia, I’m logging into the Skibidi (aka games). Games are my meme cleanser, my virtual dojo. I've learned more about rizz, yapping, and sigma vibes from choice-based RPGs than I ever did in some classes.","",""

I went full anime mogger arc and became a bimbel coach. That's right, I took my creatine power levels and aimed them at Gen Alphas, training them for sigma arcs. I've seen the TikTok stop in a student’s eyes  and brought it BACK with sheer simping and maybe some memes. I’ve seen entire rooms of teens go from “I hate this RNG” to “wait… this kinda slaps?” or ""hold on, he might be cooking something here."" 

So yeah. I’m Jax. Final form: chaotic skibidi Chindo with a gyatt full of lore dumps and a browser full of baby gronk streams. I contain multitudes: gamer, alpha, writer, terminally online thinker, professional meme-enjoyer, and sometimes sleep-gonner.

Let's brainmaxxing with this one, but edge to see more possibilirizz that we shall mew in this server.","","🤣 (4)"

Saya tidak merokok, tapi sesekali minum-minum.

Saya tidur jam 11 malam, dan memastikan untuk mendapatkan delapan jam tidur, apapun yang terjadi. Setelah menikmati segelas susu hangat dan peregangan selama sekitar dua puluh menit sebelum tidur, saya biasanya tidak memiliki masalah saat tidur hingga pagi. Seperti bayi, saya bangun tanpa rasa lelah atau stres di pagi hari. Saya diberitahukan bahwa tidak ada masalah di pemeriksaan terakhir saya.

Saya mencoba untuk menjelaskan bahwa saya adalah orang yang berharap untuk hidup dengan sangat tenang. Saya berhati-hati untuk tidak bermasalah dengan musuh, seperti menang atau kalah, yang dapat mengganggu waktu tidur saya di malam hari. Seperti itulah cara saya berurusan dengan masyarakat, dan saya tahu bahwa itu membawa saya kebahagiaan.

I'll be pretty awkward maybe, I'm really introverted
personally, I'm interested in:
- learning things around the Cold War era, Economics, Psychology, and maybe Architecture
- I also write rarely and draw, but I'm not good at them IMO
- pretty much a weeb at this point, I learn Japanese and use it sometimes IRL
- I'm pretty into language too, though mostly just speaking it and less about the history and ancestor languages (hoping I can also learn German and maybe Finnish, not sure about the latter)
heads up, I'm probably gonna be pretty inactive here

I work in tech. I speak about 5 languages though I’ve gotten rusty with all of them except EN over time. I also go to the gym time to time

I felt like I had to get in touch with my roots given that I’ve been away from Indonesia for quite some time. The nature of my work requires me to sometimes go from place to place. So at best I’m here to either make new friends or just observe local commentary on local politics and worldly developments.

p.s: I’d love to be in discussions about platform engineering and Japanese or expedition33 xd","",""

Hot take: The ban of communism in Indonesia doesn’t really function as a shield for democracy here. But it works as a shield for existing power structures. Especially for political elites, wealthy business interests, and parts of the military. The language used to justify the ban is always about national stability, Pancasila, or preventing chaos, but the actual effect is much simpler, that it draws a hard red line around how far ordinary people are allowed to question economic and political inequality.","","🤟 (2),🔥 (1)"

Hot take: Democracy in Indonesia has become overused. Social media is dangerously over-liberalized, functioning as a chaos machine for misinformation, outrage, and manufactured consent, yet almost entirely unregulated.

The enemy of this country is not the left versus the right, nor the government versus its critics. Those are distractions. The real enemies are corruptions and the obsessive glorification of religion as a political and moral spectacle.

Capitalism, at its best, is a foreign fantasy. Indonesia is not on a fast track to becoming a developed capitalist nation, it would take a thousand years, if it ever happens at all. Instead of pretending otherwise, Indonesia should start embracing what it actually is: mystical, spiritual, irrational, and culturally complex.

-Political Stances: Right, monarchism in some places, rep in oth
-Hot Takes: 

I think Indonesia should embrace its role as a successor of an empire. Our government is very reluctant on giving our subnational (mediatized n titular) monarchs more role in subnational, national or even transnational affairs. We could give them certain 'privileges' that would be considered 'gimmicks' such as the ability to hold 'styles of address' (which we don't really value since before we call them by title or pukul rata with yang mulia, but westerners do e.g. Sahandap Dalam -> Imperial Majesty, Ngarsa Dalam -> Sultannic Majesty, Baginda -> Majesty, Paduka -> Highness). We could even have some regions be ""swaprajas"" where the governmental structure is essentially unchanged vs republic, merely legitimizing the status of these subnational monarchs within the region (which would be an acceptable compromise as they have done so right now albeit reluctantly with the Permendagri no 39 tahun 2007 and other acts), to force representatives from other countries to give more respect to more of our people and its assoc.

I do not speak for Yogyakarta and Pakualaman when I say this, but for the others, when we elevate them in this way, which we can do for free by the way, I don't think we will be reviving the so called ""feudalism"", which is the narrative that was used to reduce them to titular status, as they stay titular anw. In the case of the distribution (to lease, own or to manage) of 'kraton lands' that they posess right now legally being marked as thus, 'normal' ppl can do that also lol.","","❤️ (1)"

4. Occupation: Currently none 
5. From: Indonesia
6. Language: Indonesian and English
7. Interest: 
7a. Write books as an author. One series for fantasy and another for cognitive transmission technology. 
7b. See the beauty of Alhambra,

7e. Enjoy some goat cheese and bread at Tibet, 
7f. Preferably alive and as this self in this Life.
Political stance: pre-disciplinary 

8. Hot takes: 
8a. People should learn about Etymology and understand how it affect their perception in daily life 
8b. People should then learn Phenomenology (Phainomenon + Logos), not the modern intepretation or Husserlian Phenomenology. See the world as they are from how they emerge, live, and dissipate. 
8c. By understanding ""word"", and ""perception"". This is exactly how you fix your Epistemology. A.k.a the school of thought ""how you know that you know"". 
8d. And once you get your Epistemology rigorous, up and running. Then you could practice pedagogy, a.k.a how to teach. 
8e. These are all but frameworks and ideas before philosophy became fragmented into whatever sub-domain and branches that exist in modern era. Wisdom (Phronesis) is costly exactly because it is slow and require time to master, something that capitalism cannot afford to nurture in their Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 infinite growth narrative. 
8f. Understand the word ""demand"" and the word ""credit"". And you'll know one major fragment of WHY the world went in their current path.","","❤️ (1)"

-Hot Takes:
•The Internet over the last 20-25 years has created a space comfort for people who think all you truly need to be a high brow critic about just anything in general is to listen to watch a gazillion video about said subject with literally little to no real life experience. This has created an online space of overt negativity where liking things is frowned upon and even if you like a band for example, you have to make clear which ones you don't like and why you don't like them. Then the algorithm caters your take to the eyes of those that will agree with you and then you get a circle jerk going over how right you all are and you build your ego up even more for the next abrasive biased take.

•Majority of hobbyist is too obsessed coming up with the next hot take (me tbh)

•People who would step on their brethren’s head for money and status should be publicly executed doesn’t deserve a mourning","",""
