There are three slots for bills that could be implemented per session week. Once voted on into the slots, the Parliament members work on the bills through writing down scenarios to increase success modifier. The bills can be replaced from each of the slots and replaced with a new one depending on if the parliament wants to call a re-vote. But once the Bills are implemented, it cannot be revoked. The only one to revoke it is the Supreme Justice.

Flow:
Propose Bills>Vote On Bills to Slot>Work on Bills>Implement Bills","",""

If Parliament is to handle more draft laws and bills, we are obligated to conduct more hearings, invite more experts, and commission more studies, so that the laws we produce are informed and effective.

 As my Ketum has rightly stated: *None of this, even if we were to agree with only half of what has been proposed, can be afforded with just 150 billion*.

Our transport and protocol services must also meet the standards expected of a national parliament that represents the Republic, both domestically and internationally.

Beyond that, all of this requires proper funding. That is why the increase from 150B to 800B is not excess, it is necessity.","",""

As you may have notice, miss Indah G has been.. absent. 
Some says she's off shopping for new plushiee, some says she's padelling somewhere, some says she's at a bachelor's party. Who knows! 

Anyways, shouldn't we- the people who work for our people not deserve the attention of the people's representative's leader? Shouldn't we deserve somebody who will be here, present instead? 

So now, as deputy speaker I must have you choose on what to do with Miss Indah G's position. 

Shall we wait any longer? Or shall we put her aside for a longer vacation?!
