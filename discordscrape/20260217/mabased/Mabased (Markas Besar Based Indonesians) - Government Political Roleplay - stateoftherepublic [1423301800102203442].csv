This is the current situation of Indonesia:

1. **Issue**
-**Indonesia is facing a job crisis**. About 800,000 Indonesians remain unemployed due to bad education, work quality, poor labor laws, and bad business policies that prevent the private sector to grow and hire workers. For the past three months, there has been demonstrations in the street demanding the government to step in and fix the job crisis. There is also AI stepping into industries and completely eliminating the need for the human element which contributes to the issue.
-**The Indonesian government is facing a public communication issue**. The general public trusts the opinions and the news coming from influencers and content creators than the government which fuels resentment against the government. The government must work to fix communication and build trust towards the general public.
-**Indonesia is suffering from economic inequality**. The Indonesian economy is growing, but bad trickle down policies and incompetent welfare guarantees create a massive wealth gap between the rich and the poor inside the Indonesian government. A month ago, a large demonstration of students and laborers were met with repressive action from the authorities. If this is not dealt with soon it could lead to more riots and a possible revolution. The people are demanding reformation, evaluation and rooting out of corruption. There's also a decreasing in investment.
-**There's a growing radical movement**. Due to economic hardships, there are growing amounts of people who embrace far left ideas and far right ideas for politics and economy. The government must work to either pacify the populace through policy and governance or crush this dissent.
-**The US and China tensions over Asia-Pacific is rising**. Indonesia is stuck between having to side with the US or China with two countries holding leverage over Indonesia.","",""

-**7,000 are poisoned due to bad Free Lunch Meals roll out**. At the start of his presidency, President @Kim desired to roll out the Free Lunch program and promised thousands of families that they won't have to burden themselves with buying lunch anymore. The program is given over control to Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd who is responsible for setting the core of the policy through heavy government intervention and Minister of Domestic Affairs @Tota Genkai who is responsible for the deployment of food at schools. The government must either address this problem, stop the roll outs, re-evaluate or completely cut funding which will harm President Kim's credibility.
-**A separatist force over at Kalimantan fights a war against the Indonesian government**. The Indonesian government has been fighting against the Borneo Liberation Front since 2024. They demand West Kalimantan to secede from the Republic of Indonesia. Fighting has been going for two years with 800 Indonesian soldiers dead, and 2,000 injured. Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) has been a strong proponent against this separatist movement and voices his displeasure in public, while Chief of Military @Yuru-san has been accused of incompetence and corruption despite only receiving marching orders and equipment from the Minister of Defense. Minister of Finance @Universe Janitor also has been accused of prolonging the war by continuing to budget the military operation. A resolution either peaceful or forceful is needed to break this crisis.","",""

With no news of government budget allocation from the President and Minister of Finance, as well as word from the Parliament that will approve it, government programs are beginning to deteriorate. It has been reported that 300 BJPS patients across Java and 500 BPJS patients across Sumatera has yet to receive medical care from the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, while Free Meals Lunch Program continues to roll out food that are deteriorating in quality, fueling more cases of poisoning and public uproar.

**Separatists have begun assault on Pontianak.**

The Borneo Liberation Front has begun taking over hamlets and roads heading towards Pontianak from the Southeast, with 19 soldiers dead from the attack and about 40 citizens have been killed in the firefight. The perimeter towards Pontianak has been breached due to the lack of personnel and equipment deployed to protect the city. Many military observers have noted that this is the result of late budget allocation into defense and the military contributing to a separatist breakthrough. Many blame President @Kim and Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) of not taking the situation seriously, instead focusing on political consolidation as rumors of a merger between the NAPFAR and FFA circulate in Jakarta.

**Talks Between Government and Borneo Rebels Stagnate**

After days of heavy clashes on the outskirts of Pontianak, the Ministry of Defense initiated an emergency meeting between the Armed Forces, local Sultans, and Chiefdom leaders to seek a path to peace with the Borneo Liberation Front (BLF). Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) , a native of West Borneo, personally traveled to the province to oversee the talks and persuade the rebels to halt their advance.

While the discussions managed to create limited humanitarian corridors in several hamlets, no substantial agreement was reached. The BLF continues to hold control over key routes leading to Pontianak, launching sporadic attacks despite the negotiations. Local observers describe the outcome as a “stalemate,” offering only a temporary reprieve of one or two weeks before the threat of a larger offensive resumes.

The lack of progress has intensified criticism toward President @Kim  and Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) , with accusations that the government is showing weakness at a critical moment. Many military analysts argue that the negotiations were undermined by years of delayed defense budgets and under-equipped forces in Kalimantan. Citizens in West Borneo, caught between the BLF’s advances and the government’s uncertain response, are now questioning if the state has the capacity—or the will—to secure Pontianak before it falls.","",""

**Labrador Leak: Intelligence Budget Accidentally Revealed in WhatsApp Blunder**

The nation’s intelligence community is facing an unusual storm after Chief of Security Labrador accidentally revealed a Rp 210 billion operations budget in the wrong WhatsApp groupchat. What was meant to be a classified breakdown of spending for secret informants, facilities, and day-to-day operations was instead delivered to a community chat containing journalists and local officials.

Within hours, screenshots spread across social media, sparking a meme frenzy under hashtags like #LabradorLeaks and #SpyDogBudget. Images of cartoon Labradors in sunglasses holding briefcases of cash flooded TikTok, turning what could have been a serious security breach into a national punchline.

Lawmakers, however, were less amused. Opposition figures questioned how an agency trusted with national secrets could mishandle basic messaging apps. “If they can’t manage WhatsApp, how can they manage espionage?” one parliamentarian asked during a heated session. Calls for oversight hearings grew louder as critics demanded accountability for both the blunder and the massive sums allocated.

Inside the agency, panic set in. Sources confirmed an emergency directive banning WhatsApp for official communication, with all staff ordered onto a government-issued secure messaging platform. A crash training in digital hygiene is also being rolled out, after senior officials privately admitted that operational credibility had been “seriously dented.”

As the memes keep rolling and the parliament prepares for inquiry, one question lingers: has the leak done more damage to the nation’s security, or to its sense of dignity?","","😭 (20),shockedp (6),🥀 (1),photo (1),trollstar (2)"

***MASS LABOR STRIKES IN CENTRAL JAVA***

Thousands of laborers across Central Java have launched coordinated strikes after the Ministry of Domestic Affairs @StaroW  failed to allocate any budget toward welfare programs. The workers, organized under several large unions, are demanding that the President @Kim personally intervene to protect the wong cilik — ordinary working people — by ensuring access to BPJS health coverage, family subsidies, and affordable housing projects.

The strikes have brought production lines to a standstill in key sectors. Garment and textile factories in Semarang and Solo have halted exports, Jepara’s furniture workshops are struggling to meet international contracts, and bottlenecks are emerging in food processing and agricultural distribution. Tanjung Emas Port, a vital export hub, is now reporting shipment delays as logistics workers join the action.

The political fallout is intensifying. Business owners, alarmed by mounting losses and the threat to Indonesia’s credibility as a manufacturing base, are pressuring the Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd for immediate resolution. At the same time, the Chief of Police @gingermusk faces calls from both employers and regional leaders to restore order and prevent further disruption.

Observers warn that the government’s handling of the crisis will be critical. If Jakarta fails to balance economic stability with the demands of the wong cilik, the strikes could escalate beyond Central Java, threatening investor confidence and igniting broader social unrest across the archipelago.","","💀 (8),shockedf (3)"

**CHINA OFFERS BILLIONS FOR PHASE 2 OF JAKARTA–BANDUNG HIGH-SPEED RAIL EXTENDING TO SURABAYA**

The People’s Republic of China has formally approached the Indonesian government with an offer of USD 3.2 billion in fresh investment to continue Phase 2 of the Jakarta–Bandung High-Speed Bullet Train project, extending the line towards Surabaya. The move signals Beijing’s determination to deepen its role in Indonesia’s infrastructure development, but also raises sensitive questions about Jakarta’s foreign policy alignment.

While the investment promises thousands of new jobs and a major boost to transport connectivity, analysts warn that accepting the deal could be read as Indonesia drifting further from Washington’s orbit. U.S. officials have previously expressed concern that China’s Belt and Road investments consolidate strategic leverage across Southeast Asia.

The decision now sits at the heart of a political and diplomatic dilemma. The Minister of Foreign Affairs @Tota Genkai  is tasked with managing the potential fallout with Western partners, particularly the United States. The Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd  is under pressure from business groups to seize the opportunity, citing growth and investor confidence. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance @Universe Janitor faces scrutiny over the long-term debt implications, as Phase 1 of the high-speed rail already drew criticism for cost overruns and financial opacity.

Political observers note that President @Kim 's cabinet is split. Proponents argue that refusing China’s offer would stall a flagship national project, while opponents fear the geopolitical price of appearing overly dependent on Beijing. As negotiations proceed, the government must weigh economic ambition against the delicate balance of Indonesia’s non-aligned foreign policy tradition.","","shocked (2),🇨🇳 (6),🤑 (5),💹 (2)"

**Anonymous Accounts Spread False Allegations Amid Central Java Crisis**

A wave of anonymous social media accounts and unverified blogs sparked controversy yesterday after circulating claims that the President and the Minister of Finance held a secret coalition meeting during the ongoing crisis in Central Java.

The posts, which appeared simultaneously on multiple platforms, accused both leaders of “neglecting the people” and “pursuing political power instead of solutions.” However, checks conducted by a Verification Team found no evidence of such a meeting taking place, nor of any cabinet reorganization related to the claims.

“We see clear signs of coordinated disinformation—identical wording, synchronized timing, and use of clickbait-style hashtags,” said the Digital Integrity Institute.

Government Spokesperson condemned the attempt, calling it “irresponsible and exploitative.”

“The administration’s focus remains on crisis relief, not political maneuvering,” she said during a brief press conference. “Efforts to manipulate the public at a time like this endanger unity and trust.”

Meanwhile, several digital rights groups expressed concern that the spread of fabricated information could worsen polarization online. 

Analytics firm TaktikData reported that most of the viral posts originated from accounts with low engagement histories, many created within the past two weeks. Some of those accounts have since been suspended.

Despite the government’s swift rebuttal, the episode has reignited debate over the role of paid influencers and anonymous “buzzers” in shaping political narratives — a recurring theme in Indonesia’s evolving information landscape.

Public reaction, meanwhile, has largely condemned the smear, with many online users rallying under the hashtag #CrisisNotPolitics, urging focus on humanitarian response rather than partisan games.","",""

**INDONESIA REJECTS MYANMAR EXTRADITION REQUEST, OFFERS HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL INSTEAD**

In a move that has sent ripples through both ASEAN and international diplomatic circles, the Minister of Justice, Nero, has formally rejected Myanmar’s request to extradite a political dissident currently detained in Indonesia. Instead, Nero has proposed to host an independent tribunal on Indonesian soil, citing serious concerns over the dissident’s right to due process and fears of possible torture or execution if returned to Myanmar.

“Indonesia cannot, in good conscience, be complicit in the potential violation of human rights,” said Minister Nero in a late-night press briefing. “We are a sovereign nation with our own commitment to justice.”

The decision comes amidst mounting pressure from human rights organizations, international legal watchdogs, and urban civil society groups, many of whom had taken to social media and street demonstrations urging the Indonesian government not to hand over the dissident. The move has earned Nero significant praise both domestically and abroad, with several international NGOs hailing Indonesia’s commitment to human rights as “a landmark decision for Southeast Asian democracy.”

However, the decision has not come without cost. Several Myanmar-aligned firms and Chinese business entities have begun pulling investments and delaying infrastructure projects in Kalimantan and Sumatra, triggering what experts call a “contained but visible economic chill.”

The Ministry of Finance has already downgraded short-term growth projections by −1 point in response, though officials maintain the fundamentals of the Indonesian economy remain stable.

“We are watching the market closely,” said Minister Universe Janitor. “The decision to uphold human rights is not incompatible with our long-term growth model.”

Hundreds of protestors have gathered this morning in front of the People’s Representative Council (PRC), decrying what they call a “dereliction of duty” by Parliament over the tardy ratification of the National Budget. The protest is one of the largest in recent years and includes students, workers, BPJS health advocates, teachers’ unions, indigenous groups, and victims’ families from the Borneo Liberation conflict zones.

“Our medicine has run out. Our children are hungry. Our hospitals have no supplies,” said a protestor from Kalimantan Timur
‘We Die While They Debate’.
“Why is Parliament fighting over seats while our villages burn?”

This delay affects:
1. BPJS Health Services in remote provinces report rationing medicine and delaying elective procedures.
2. The Free Meals Program for Public Schools, a flagship welfare policy, has halted in 42 districts due to lack of funding.
3. Strategic infrastructure projects across Kalimantan and Papua—including bridges, roads, and telecommunication hubs—have stopped construction mid-phase.
4. Military and logistical support to the Borneo Liberation Front conflict zones have been stretched thin, with some units reporting late or absent resupply for over two weeks.

“The delay in Parliament has directly cost us lives,” said a source within the Joint Defense Command, referencing the 2,000 casualties reported so far in the Borneo insurgency. The Speaker of the Parliament, @G CAT  (DemPro), is reportedly refusing to fast-track the budget until President @Kim increases parliamentary budget.

Several protesters have begun calling for the resignation of key political figures, including:

**YOSKA DECLARES DAERAH OPERASI MILITER WEST KALIMANTAN, MAJOR OPERATION FAILS SPECTACULARLY**

In a historic and controversial move, Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) , with direct approval from President @Kim , has officially declared the entire province of West Kalimantan a Daerah Operasi Militer.

The decision comes amid a worsening crisis involving the Borneo Liberation Front (BLF), whose insurgency has claimed over 2,000 lives in the past 18 months. The DOM declaration grants sweeping authority to the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to conduct operations across civilian territories, impose curfews, establish checkpoints, and eliminate high-value targets with minimal civilian oversight.

The declaration of DOM follows the launch of Operation Kabut, a TNI-led military operation aimed at neutralizing BLF leadership through a joint effort of special forces and drone support. The operation deployed 3 squads of Kopassus, several transport helicopter and drones.

The mission objective was the targetting of BLF high command believed to be operating deep within the jungles of West Kalimantan. However, the operation ended in failure. According to high-level sources within the Ministry of Defence: The BLF leadership escaped the raid, potentially wounded.","",""

**CABINET SECRETARY SHIAWASE BLUNDERS AFTER PUBLIC EXPOSE**

Cabinet Secretary @shiawase  (FFA) found himself in the eye of a political storm after making a surprise public announcement accusing three ministries of ""complete inaction"" following Parliament’s approval of the national budget.

The ministries named — Justice ( @ebonydarknessdementiaravenway , PJF), Finance ( @Universe Janitor , NUP), and Energy and Resources ( @retropolism , PJF) — were blasted by Shiawase for “not even preparing their draft programs” three days after the budget's passing.

But what was intended as a call to accountability has instead sparked cabinet infighting, social media backlash, and an emerging narrative that Shiawase’s actions were politically motivated and potentially destabilizing during an ongoing national crisis.

#MenteriNgadu and #SeskabNgamuk trend online as many believe Shiawase's expose is politically charged. Opinion split: some applaud the boldness, others call it “attention-seeking theatrics”.

Satirical memes of Shiawase wearing a “Minister Monitor” badge go viral.

An episode of ""Indonesia's Judging Club"" discussed this issue and some of the speakers in the episode accused Shiawase of softly sabotaging the workings of the cabinet.","","🤣 (6),😔 (2)"

**PARLIAMENT IS ON LIMBO FOR ALMOST A MONTH**

After the ratification of the 2026 Budget, the Parliament has seen no further discussion in pushing any bills, as the public faces a job crisis and constituents demand for their representatives to push Bills. Speaker of the Parliament @G CAT has not surfaced in the public view since a few weeks after the ratification of the 2026 Budget, while Deputy Speaker @Deleted User has been seen attending party rallies and meetings rather than fulfilling her duty in the parliament.

Social media is beginning to be abuzz, questioning whether or not the Parliament is able do deliver bills for its people, with many people calling President @Kim and the other party bosses to begin mobilizing bills. The public worry that their representatives are not doing the jobs they're supposed to be doing.

**POLICE OPERATION FAILS TO IDENTIFY CYBER MASTERMIND IN CENTRAL JAVA**

Amid the spiraling Central Java labor crisis, a cyber-intelligence operation launched by the Chief of Police @gingermusk to identify the mastermind behind a rapidly spreading disinformation campaign has failed to produce results, sparking fresh concerns about state surveillance, digital incompetence, and political cover-ups.

The operation, initiated to trace the origins of anonymous accounts flooding social media with coordinated accusations against President @Kim  and Minister of Finance @Universe Janitor, ended in disarray after investigators reported that the campaign was routed through a complex mesh of proxy servers, false IPs, and burner accounts. Instead of unmasking the actors, investigators reportedly struck dead ends and, worse, flagged unrelated civilian accounts, raising questions of privacy violation.

Though official verification teams quickly labeled the online accusations as “unsubstantiated and algorithmically amplified,” the public has been largely unconvinced. Hashtags like #DigitalFail, #CyberBlunder, and #WhoPolicesThePolice trended across platforms, while civil society groups accused the police of ""wasting taxpayer money chasing shadows.""

The disinformation campaign itself remains active. Anonymous accounts continue to circulate messages accusing the administration of colluding with corporate elites to suppress labor demands. Though experts say the accounts display “clear hallmarks of artificial coordination” — such as identical phrasing, synchronized posting, and recent creation — the mastermind remains unknown.

The timing of the campaign, coinciding with budget delays and ongoing labor unrest in Semarang, Salatiga, and Surakarta, has led to growing speculation of internal sabotage or even foreign interference.","","shockedf (1),💀 (2)"

**ATTEMPTED ARSON ALMOST BURNT MINISTER STAROW'S HOUSE**

At night in 2am, a man was apprehended by members of the Indonesian police force attempting to start a fire on Minister @StaroW 's residence. The man, identified as West Javan native Amir Sundaman, was resentful over the recent Free Meals Program that put his son into a state of coma after his son was poisoned by the free meal. While Minister StaroW and his family was unharmed, the fire managed to burn the security post of his residence.

The police suspected that this attack was politically motivated, as the attacker Amir Sundaman seems to be a part of a right wing focus group, however reports are inconclusive at best and many of the public criticized the government for accusing Amir's violent act as politically motivated when many believed he was acting out of passion.

This attack came as the Ministry of Domestic Affairs were slow to act regarding the Free Lunch Program and overhauling its roll outs. What will the cabinet do as some in Indonesia are contemplating violence against its leaders?","",""

The government is undergoing training of various kitchens, staff, cooks and experts to improve the quality of the meals allocating 340B IDR in budget.

**Government Launches Rp 500 Billion Infrastructure Boost to Develop Outer Islands**

The Indonesian government, under Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd  has unveiled a bold Rp 500 trillion infrastructure policy package aimed at accelerating development outside Java, especially in Kalimantan and Papua. This initiative is expected to enhance connectivity, public services, and digital access in neglected regions.

Breakdown of the allocation includes:

Rp 200B for the construction and maintenance of rural roads, bridges, irrigation, sanitation systems, and flood control, with a strong focus on local SMEs for project execution.

Rp 100B dedicated to renovating schools, clinics, and hospitals, improving visibility and access to vital public services.

Rp 100B invested into communication infrastructure, expanding 5G coverage, building more BTS towers, and upgrading satellite internet through collaboration with Telkom and Starlink.

Rp 75B to fund vocational training programs and job distribution, especially in coordination with regional governments.

Rp 25B for monitoring, logistics, procurement, and administrative operations.

Experts view the initiative as a potential game-changer for regional equity. “This is a chance to bridge the development gap between Java and the rest of Indonesia,” said one economist. However, concerns remain about corruption, project delays, and the capacity of ministries to execute such a large-scale plan effectively. Transparency and coordination, they warn, will be critical. Public reaction is mixed—many praise the focus on outer islands, while others worry about corruption and demand transparency in project execution.","","🥵 (1),sniff (1)"

**MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST BORNEAN SEPARATISTS REACHED BREAKTHROUGH**

In a dramatic and closely watched campaign, Indonesian security forces have declared a decisive victory in West Kalimantan after a months‑long offensive against the Borneo Liberation Front (BLF), the insurgent group that for more than a year had terrorized towns, disrupted services and claimed thousands of lives across the region. Government officials announced early today that the coordinated operation — a multi‑service campaign involving the Indonesian Army’s strategic reserves, naval and marine units, and air force assets — successfully dismantled the BLF’s operational command and restored formal control over the province’s major population centers, most notably Pontianak.

President @Kim addressed the nation with a measured tone, emphasizing both relief and resolve. “Today we mark a turning point for West Borneo and for the Republic,” he said. “Our armed forces, working with local authorities and supported by humanitarian agencies, have ended a reign of terror that took too many lives. We will now move from combat operations to a rapid and transparent program of stabilization, reconstruction and justice.”

Government sources say the campaign was launched after domestic efforts to contain the insurgency failed to halt its expansion into urban peripheries. The declaration of a Daerah Operasi Militer (DOM) placed the theater under centralized military command and allowed Jakarta to mobilize additional resources and capabilities. According to the Defense Ministry, the offensive prioritized the protection of civilians and the reclamation of key infrastructure: roads, bridges, water works and health facilities that insurgent attacks had repeatedly targeted.","","👍 (1)"
