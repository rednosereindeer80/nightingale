Ke manakah orang-orang pergi ketika di persimpangan yang padat? (Bagai terbawa arus)
Selalu memakai seragam yang sama dan ekspresi wajah yang sama

Seolah menyatu di dalam keramaian dan terus berjalan (Tanpa disadari)

Apakah yang membuat kita ragu untuk berbeda dengan orang lain?

Jangan masuk ke dalam barisan orang yang berlalu itu
Meski mengikuti aturan, mata mereka seolah mati

Kau memiliki kebebasan untuk hidup dengan caramu sendiri
Jangan mau terpengaruh oleh orang dewasa
Ya, jika sejak awal kita sudah menyerah
Lalu untuk apa kita hidup di dunia ini?

Mengejar mimpi itu terkadang bisa membuatmu merasa kesepian
Harus maju di jalan tanpa siapa pun
Dunia ini takkan dimulai jika kamu dalam kawanan
Apakah ""ya"" Saja cukup? Mayoritas yang diam

Presiden yang berkuasa di negara suatu tempat berkata (Seenaknya sendiri)
Bagi yang tak mengeluarkan suara maka mereka menyetujuinya

Memilih adalah hal yang penting, jangan serahkan pada orang lain

Jika tak bertindak, maka ""tidak"" takkan bisa dikatakan

Kau harus melakukan hal yang kau inginkan dengan caramu sendiri
Jangan mau menjadi satu di antara mereka
Meski di sini ada jalan bagi keramaian orang
Lebih baik melangkah dengan mimpi masing-masing

Bagaikan diikat oleh rantai kesombongan dan tampilan
Orang dewasa yang membosankan hanya diam saja
Sekarang masa depan itu ada untuk kalian semua
Katakan ""tidak""! Mayoritas yang diam

Jika terus mengikuti langkah seseorang
Mungkin kita takkan terluka
Tetapi jika Kerumunan itu dianggap sebagai
Kesepakatan bersama kita akan disamaratakan

Kau memiliki kebebasan untuk hidup dengan caramu sendiri
Jangan mau terpengaruh oleh orang dewasa
Ya, jika sejak awal kita sudah menyerah
Lalu untuk apa kita hidup di dunia ini?

Mengejar mimpi itu terkadang bisa membuatmu merasa kesepian
Harus maju di jalan tanpa siapa pun
Dunia ini takkan dimulai jika kamu dalam kawanan
Apakah ""ya"" Saja cukup? Mayoritas yang diam","",""

Berdaya diri bukan hanya tentang siapa yang paling kuat, atau siapa yang paling tangguh. Tapi siapa yang mampu menerima segala hal yang terjadi dengan hati lapang. Yang selalu menebar kebaikan di setiap langkah, meski kamu tahu baikmu tak selalu berbalas baik.
Memang, tidak semudah itu untuk memaafkan dan merelakan. Tapi percayalah, hadiah indah akan menanti orang-orang yang tak lelah berjuang dan berdoa.

BERDAYA DIRI

Satu-satu cara kau coba
Untuk menjadi bermakna
Hingga hatimu bertanya-tanya
Apa yang kau cari di gemerlapnya dunia?
Jika sinarnya nyata dalam dirimu

Tak usah dengarkan mereka
Yang membuat harimu lelah
Tak perlu mengubah apapun
Kamu berharga, apa adanya

Kelak perjuanganmu kan temukan jalannya
Langkah kecilmu membawa harapan
Arungi semua dan
Memberi kebaikan
Berani melangkah hadapi dunia

Yakini untuk kita percaya
Karena kita bermakna

Pernahkah kau sadari
Hebatnya dirimu yang selalu tangguh?
Mengalahkan sang takut
Hapus semua ragu
Hingga kau temukan dirimu
Berdaya, bermakna

Kelak perjuanganmu kan temukan jalannya
Langkah kecilmu membawa harapan
Arungi semua dan
Memberi kebaikan
Berani melangkah hadapi dunia
Yakini untuk kita percaya
Karena kita bermakna

Oooo...
Karena kita bermakna

Oooo...

Berdaya diri

oh boy, look what you’ve done
got me thinking you’re the one
my mind’s running quizzes
A B C D

you change from hot to cold
are you shy or playing cool?
I can’t read you, like a riddle
guess I have to make you

tell me, tell me, baby boy
are you S or N or J or P
so tell me what’s your vibe, what’s your joy
I just wanna know you honestly

hah… I’m so tired always looking for signs
can you tell me what’s your MBTI
so I can grab my phone and look it up, up, up

hah… tell me how you’re always looking so fine
can you tell me what’s your MBTI
I really don’t mind

how did I not notice you
when you’re next to me
Mr. Mystery

tell me, tell me, baby boy
are you S or N or J or P
so tell me what’s your vibe, what’s your joy
I just wanna know you honestly

hah… I’m so tired always looking for signs
can you tell me what’s your MBTI

Lyrics

Nowhere to turn 
Nowhere to hide 
Between a rock and a hard place 
Someone to find 
I know that times are tough, just down and out 
Putting my faith in tomorrow  

I'm ready to go but I don’t know where to start 
Each and every road seems to be calling to me 
Pulled in every which way, so I made my own path 
A deep breath, and my best foot forward  

One small step from zero 
I'm not afraid 
cuz the world that we want is right here for us to make 
Just taking one small step to hero 
I'll take the chance 
And when I do I'll be thinking of the same thing I always do 
It's always you","",""

DREAM HIGH
Indonesian Translation
By Flora Marcela

I dream high, aku bermimpi
Walau sulit kan kujalani
akan. slalu kuingat sampai nyata
ku akan bangkit dan mengejarnya

Rasa takutku memuncak
hatiku pun berdebar
seperti burung
baru belajar terbang
akankah terjatuh? 

Lagi-lagi kuulangi
kutak yakin kubisa
saat kutakut 
keyakinanku maju
selangkah demi selangkah

I dream high, aku bermimpi
Walau sulit kan kujalani
akan. slalu kuingat sampai nyata
ku akan bangkit dan mengejarnya

I can fly
aku percaya 
terbang tinggi
di angkasa
dengan kebebasan
terus berkembang
sayapku membentang
makin tinggi dan lagi

Beri aku kekuatan 
tuk bisa bangkit lagi
keberanian, 
tuk hapuskan takutku
dan berlari kembali

Sekali lagi percaya
pada diri sendiri
ku kan mendaki setiap
tembok tinggi
yang merintangi mimpi

I dream high, aku bermimpi
Walau sulit kan kujalani
akan. slalu kuingat sampai nyata
ku akan bangkit dan mengejarnya

I can fly
aku percaya 
terbang tinggi
di angkasa
dengan kebebasan
terus berkembang
sayapku membentang
makin tinggi dan lagi

Rap
dream high
a chance to fly high
lepaskan rasa sakit
ucapkan bye bye
cobalah terbang tinggi
dan capailah bintang
kejarlah mimpimu
kau terlihat bersinar
mimpimu adalah 
milikmu seorang
sekarang gotta 
make them mine
jangan menyerah
sampai semua berubah
lepaskan ragumu
percaya diri
karena destiny
tak bisa dihindari
sekarang hadapi
kenyataan ini
buatlah mimpi
come with me
take my hand let's run fast
in the road of dream
kita berjalan 
menuju masa depan
terus mimpi yang tinggi 
jangan berhenti
percaya, usaha
sampai semua mimpi
dan kerja kerasmu
berbuah disini

I dream high, aku bermimpi
Walau sulit kan kujalani
akan. slalu kuingat sampai nyata
ku akan bangkit dan mengejarnya

I can fly
aku percaya 
terbang tinggi
di angkasa
dengan kebebasan
terus berkembang
sayapku membentang
makin tinggi dan lagi

Begitu banyak cerita
Tentang penghuni dunia
Seolah mereka tak tahu diri

Begitu banyak cerita
Tentang hidup manusia
Yang selalu terbawa emosi diri

Gengsi selalu menjadi
Pedoman hidup manusia
Gengsi membuat mereka
Menjadi lupa diri

Harga diri manusia
Kini menjadi bencana
Seolah tiada artinya lagi

Mereka terus berlomba
Mengejar harta dunia
Setan-setan yang kini tertawa bahagia

***Lihatlah dimana-mana
Banyak disana yang menjadi korban***

Gengsi selalu menjadi
Pedoman hidup manusia
Gengsi membuat mereka
Menjadi lupa diri

Harga diri manusia
Kini menjadi bencana
Seolah tiada artinya lagi

Mereka terus berlomba
Mengejar harta dunia
Setan-setan yang kini tertawa bahagia

Harga diri manusia
Kini menjadi bencana
Seolah tiada artinya lagi

Mereka terus berlomba
Mengejar harta dunia
Setan-setan yang kini tertawa bahagia

Harga diri manusia
Kini menjadi bencana
Seolah tiada artinya lagi

Mereka terus berlomba
Mengejar harta dunia
Setan-setan yang kini tertawa bahagia

Harga diri manusia
Kini menjadi bencana
Seolah tiada artinya lagi

Lyrics:
(Verse 1)
Dulu semua tampak mudah
Dunia penuh warna cerah
Tapi waktu terus berjalan
Tak selalu indah, tak selalu ramah

(Pre-Chorus)
Kadang jatuh, kadang kalah
Namun jangan lari menyerah
Dewasa bukan soal usia
Tapi hati yang bijaksana

(Chorus)
Jadilah dewasa, berpikir luas
Melihat dunia dengan ikhlas
Jangan hanya menuntut semua
Mulailah dari dirimu juga

(Verse 2)
Bukan tentang menang sendiri
Bukan tentang ego di hati
Belajar dari tiap luka
Bangkit lagi, kuatkan jiwa

(Bridge)
Saat badai datang menerpa
Jangan gentar, tetap percaya
Langkah kecil yang kau jalani
Kan membawa arti dalam hidup ini

(Outro)
***Jadilah dewasa, berpikir luas
Melihat dunia dengan ikhlas
Jangan hanya menuntut semua
Mulailah dari dirimu juga***

(Verse 2)
Bukan tentang menang sendiri
Bukan tentang ego di hati
Belajar dari tiap luka
Bangkit lagi, kuatkan jiwa

I'm connecting together and drawing mosaic pieces one by one
As well as the encounter and parting you gave me

I think, ""It shouldn't be like this,"" and go to sleep
And when I awaken, it's the same old unchanging, fruitless effort
I repeat it meaninglessly

I picked up and gathered the mosaic pieces for ""a way to live a good life""
That warped thing seemed beautiful to me
Above the path I chose to the end while I bluffed, while I failed
The pieces came unstuck and fell, and I would not bury them

A world spread all over every will
Even though I must have something I can't yield to anyone
I'm worried about the multiple colors

While bewitched by the various colors and shapes in the mosaic pieces
I wished far too much for ""youthful indiscretion""
Believing in the cement of love in the gaps in my heart, I washed down
Pieces that will never, ever melt together

Because contrast is beautiful, roughness conversely works well
For some reason, I won't wait for my turn and find my own style of answer

The mosaic pieces brilliantly project the lies and mistakes of my past
The more I think I want to erase them all
The more I still can't advance past the start line there when I turn around
I'll try picking up and gathering my dreams once more
I'm connecting together and drawing mosaic pieces one by one
As well as the encounter and parting you gave me","",""

Count ""one!"" and continue on
count ""two!"" and take a break
count ""three!"" and think
just continue on at your own pace

time flows you're left behind
don't forget that impatient feeling
don't say that the reckless challenge
was futile after all; don't give up

offense! when you're in pain
let's let out a whisper and go
offense! face yourself toward
the direction you're aiming

no cowering at the giant wall
towering before you
no hesitating at this life
that has no answer either
keep to your own pace

count ""one!"" and continue on
count ""two!"" and take a break
count ""three!"" and think
just continue on at your own pace

not understanding the real reason to learn
we lose our freedom
even if we're called cowards
we yield one step that is courage

offense! let's not worry about our surroundings
let's let out our voices and go
offense! let's relax our shoulders and
now, let's face it

as for the picture of the future drawn into the sky
even if we don't arrive at it now
some day let's stretch out both arms
and go grab it
keep to your own pace

offense! let's try letting out
as big a voice as we can
offense! face yourself toward
the direction you're aiming

no cowering at the giant wall
towering before you
even if you keep running away saying it won't happen
there are no substitutions

the bell has begun to resound
now is the time to take a stand
no hesitating at this life that
has no answer
keep to your own pace

count ""one!"" and continue on
count ""two!"" and take a break
count ""three!"" and think
just continue on at your own pace","",""

Ah, that day the baby bird takes flight to conquer the endless skies......

When? I believed ――
when I was young and didn't doubt the world
Why? Because I loved ――
someone precious to me and whom I trusted

I left the earth and, excited, I flew for the first time to the loneliness of heaven

Black or White?
What is right? I want to find out myself

Where? I was trapped ――
in my shell and couldn't break it
What? I searched ――
for something to hold on to, even though it might hurt me

After leaving I watched the winds dancing free in the sky and shuddered

Black or White?
Who is right? I want to see it for myself

―― What I understood was
that justice is overflowing and the world is determined to repeat it conflicts

[Black] or [white]... Two or one... Things are not so simple...
Even so... In this grey world... I would like to go on the path... I believe in...

Black or White?
No matter how long the nights may be, we won't give up
Black and White, I'm giving my all to live this moment
We just want to protect this world, so we'll gather our courage and fight!

That day the baby bird takes flight to conquer the endless skies,
with the wind at her side, she is heading towards a still invisible horizon......","",""

Terjemahan Indonesia
Google Translate

Ah, hari itu burung kecil terbang untuk menaklukkan langit yang tak berujung......

Kapan? Aku percaya
ketika aku masih muda dan tidak meragukan dunia
Mengapa? Karena aku mencintai
seseorang yang berharga bagiku dan yang kupercayai

Aku meninggalkan bumi dan, dengan gembira, aku terbang untuk pertama kalinya
ke kesunyian surga

Hitam atau Putih?
Apa yang benar? Aku ingin mencari tahu sendiri

Di mana? Aku terperangkap
di dalam cangkangku dan tidak bisa memecahkannya
Apa? Aku mencari
sesuatu untuk dipegang, meskipun itu mungkin menyakitiku

Setelah pergi, aku menyaksikan angin menari bebas di langit dan bergidik

Hitam atau Putih?
Siapa yang benar? Aku ingin melihatnya sendiri

Yang kupahami adalah keadilan melimpah ruah dan dunia bertekad untuk mengulangi konflik yang sama

[Hitam] atau [putih]... Dua atau satu... Segalanya tidak sesederhana itu...
Meskipun begitu... Di dunia kelabu ini... Aku ingin menempuh jalan... yang kupercayai...

Hitam atau Putih?
Tidak peduli seberapa panjang malam itu, kita tidak akan menyerah
Hitam dan Putih, aku memberikan segalanya untuk menjalani momen ini
Kita hanya ingin melindungi dunia ini, jadi kita akan mengumpulkan keberanian dan berjuang!

Pada hari itu, burung kecil terbang untuk menaklukkan langit yang tak berujung,
dengan angin di sisinya, ia menuju cakrawala yang masih tak terlihat......","",""

Lirik

Bukalah matamu lihat saja
Tak akan ada beban di hati
Rasakan bebasnya, ekspresikanlah dirimu

Segalanya 'kan terjadi bila kita
Tak menutupi hati dan rasa
Jadi lepaskanlah, tersenyumlah pada dunia

Setiap hari ku jalani semuanya dengan pasti
Ikuti kata hati
Dan aku tak pernah sekalipun tuk mencoba
Mengingat segala sedih lihat ke belakang lagi

Jauhkanlah (Jauhkanlah)
Putus asa (Putus asa)
Jalanilah saja (What, what, what, woo)

Bukalah matamu lihat saja
Tak akan ada beban di hati
Rasakan bebasnya, ekspresikanlah dirimu

Segalanya 'kan terjadi bila kita
Tak menutupi hati dan rasa
Jadi lepaskanlah, tersenyumlah pada dunia

Coba kita lakukan segala yang kita suka
Apa yang kita rasa
Tanpa harus kita pikir-pikir dengan s'lalu hati-hati
Malah jadi tak berani

Jauhkanlah (Jauhkanlah)
Putus asa (Putus asa)
Jalanilah saja (Jalani saja, yeah)

Bukalah matamu lihat saja
Tak akan ada beban di hati
Rasakan bebasnya, ekspresikanlah dirimu

Segalanya 'kan terjadi bila kita
Tak menutupi hati dan rasa
Jadi lepaskanlah, tersenyumlah pada dunia

Lepaskanlah
Bebaskan, ye-yeah

Hey, keluarin semua nyali dalam diri lo
Bikin yang beda jek, jangan cuma mencontoh
Nanti jadi bodoh bisanya melongo
Planga-plongo, planga-plongo
Kok kayak gitu loh (No way)

Bukalah matamu lihat saja
Tak akan ada beban di hati
Rasakan bebasnya, ekspresikanlah dirimu

Segalanya 'kan terjadi bila kita
Tak menutupi hati dan rasa
Jadi lepaskanlah
Lepaskanlah, tersenyumlah pada dunia

Bukalah matamu lihat saja
Tak akan ada beban di hati
Rasakan bebasnya
Ekspresikanlah dirimu kawan

Segalanya 'kan terjadi bila kita
Tak menutupi hati dan rasa
Jadi lepaskanlah
Tersenyumlah pada dunia

✊ Lyrics

The world sets back to the dark,
The soldier shoot their guns to the weak people and turn off the right to love
And rulers claim they’re God ready to take the power back
To destroy anyone
To clean some ethic
To create uniformity
And to throw some religion

Woman and child just cry
Can’t run, then die, die, die
Woman and child just cry
Can’t leave from fire of war

Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!
Stop war! We hate war!

Woman and child just cry
Can’t run, then die, die, die
Woman and child just cry
Can’t leave from fire of war
Woman and child just cry
Can’t run, then die, die, die
Woman and child just cry
Can’t leave from fire of war

Woman and child just cry
Can’t run, then die, die, die
Woman and child just cry
Can’t leave from fire of war
Woman and child just cry
Can’t run, then die, die, die
Woman and child just cry
Can’t leave from fire of war

In the bright of bombs! Bombs! Bombs!","",""

Autum is neither birth nor death, neither harvest nor famine, neither young nor old.

It is more like ageing, growing old, towards death, hence the somber tone, but not entirely depressing. Not even somber, maybe even mysterious

From then on, there will be rebirth and growth, spring to be exact. But first, one must experience winter, hence the minor in the end","","💪 (1)"

Intestine Baalism were one of the first significant death metal band to ever come out of Japan, and they sound more like something that came straight out of Sweden. It really is the product of Dismember and Entombed influence where most of the album is just straight up old school death metal, even the melodic part of the album feels very “dark” compared to the majority of the melodeath scene where they lean towards very happy sounding leads. The memorable leads everyone is talking about just happened to he smacked right in the middle or at the end of every track (which is actually the typical Japanese-style music), but oh my GOD once you finished it, you want to listen to it over and over again for that ASTONISHING guitar works. Like holy shit it’s straight out of a very dramatic boss fight finale or a finale to a very peak anime if you would like to put it that way, especially the B-side of this album which is THE PEAKEST OF PEAK A MELODIC DEATH METAL ALBUM CAN EVER BE!!!!

I have no words. No lengthy long yapping review, the music and the album cover explain itself. If you ever wonder what hell would sounds like musically, it’s this album, literal music made by anti Christ and the spawns of Hell. 

From the production, the songwriting, the vocal deliverance, and the top tier over the top blasphemous edgy lyrics about Christianity. This album will put you in a burning room filled with demons singing about Jesus and the Father in the most blasphemous way, brutal.
