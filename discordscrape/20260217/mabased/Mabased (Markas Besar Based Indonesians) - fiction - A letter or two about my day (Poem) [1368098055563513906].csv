Haha well, besides it being bad and lacking poetic diction
I like to fill it up with niche references, you see

I wonder if sometimes its too apparent and that you'd laugh at my attempt to be obscure
""Poetry is in your laughs and it seeps through that teethy smile you have"" you say
But oh how wrong you are
If i carry poetry with me then darling you'd be my writer you'd be my sole reason of existence
But you wont realize that of course
The butterfly cant look at how beautiful its wings are

I throw papers at your window, some of it is inscribed with our inside jokes
Laugh at it darling; miss me if you havent
Ive spent too long just rambling about my feelings about you
So heres some pretty words so i can call this ""poetry""

""Yearn.
I never really noticed that the creaky floorboard sound were my grin widening at your stupid little jokes
Nor the drum band playing down the street was really my heartbeat when you call me honey; (p.s the double rhythm was my heart having a stroke !)
I never let anyone else call me honey did you know that?

I wonder if you noticed the long silences when we called were me thinking of us in a not so distant future
You've always hated the silence but to me it was my favourite song ever

But i notice everything now, ever since you're gone
Ever since you're gone the floor creaks a little bit differently; once an old wooden floor in my grandmas warm house now just an annoying wood panel that i cant be bothered to fix
Ever since you're gone the drum band's been playing a little bit out of tune, out of tempo, seems like they need a new drummer but nothing can really replace that groove, you know

And the long silences fell short
And i started to notice everything again for the third time""

I feel its sad, about with who we experiences something that become our thinking perception,becomes ourself
,I don't know really, I just like butterfly and beautifull meaning full, useful to me, thank you for this beautifull and make me think,about someone and to cherish the time with them, and what is the third time?...","",""

I notice the silence, which is very loud, then it stops, and it becomes silent, and i notice it becoming silent again, which is very loud","",""
