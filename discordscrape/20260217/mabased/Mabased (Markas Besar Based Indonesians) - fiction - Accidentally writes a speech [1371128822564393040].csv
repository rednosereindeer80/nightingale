We as a country, is the example of mediocrity, are walking the path of what past nations have seen and done before; the frame of which how we experience it may differ, but the way we are born, rise, and eventually fall will be the same. We are not unique as a nation; the sooner we accept that fact, the longer we will endure. Empires rise and fall, but nations that forge an identity build upon a common cause that unites the squabbling tribes of our nation is what will be better than an imperial legacy.

Rome: that city whose light shines upon the western world casts upon such a large shadow that even in the crevices and muck of this earth has fallen, its record vandalized and then adorned as a costume by its destroyer. All of the claim successor states still littered the earth for more than a thousand years.

I do not want that---to be the fate of our nation, being the record of some minor warlord to claim upon majesty. I want our nation to endure; even after countless invasions and ransacks, I want our people to still united. Adapting, always changing, but in its core always the same, our names may be discarded, but we must be the same people.

Rome's legacy may still shine, but it is still gone. We must our brothers in the north, long united, must be divided, and long divided must be united.

what good is a legacy if our people, if they lie scattered and battling the scraps of glory? What good is a name if that dream we made and promised almost 80 years ago lies in the gutters of history? no, no, **NO---i WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN!!!**.","",""

# OUR DUTY IS ETERNAL, BEYOND THE GRAVE, IF WE MUST FIGHT TO MAINTAIN IT!!

# OUR DUTY IS TO THIS REPUBLIC, AND I WILL NOT LET OUR NATION BE A FOOTNOTE IN OTHERS' HISTORY!!

My love for this country is too great to let that happen, and for that, we as its citizens must fight, must endure, must **rage** towards the enemy. From within and beyond.","",""
