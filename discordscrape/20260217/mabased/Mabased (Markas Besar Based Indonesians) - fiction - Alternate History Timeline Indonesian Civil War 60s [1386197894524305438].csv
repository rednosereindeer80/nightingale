Anyone got any ideas? Especially for the communist faction?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1386197894524305438/1386197895388205116/98084670_810a8f8a-2bb2-4241-b6de-757b9367a576.png?ex=69968e64&is=69953ce4&hm=57c1213dbf9e7e4bcadf855cc0cc74d2950bb92e9256d43a5e1fe3eab0051eac&",""

I’m thinking something like the 'People’s Republic of Indonesia' or maybe it's better if it's a loose front? idk what's better tbh, though I want it to sounds authentic to the era and ideology. Any suggestions or ideas?","",""
