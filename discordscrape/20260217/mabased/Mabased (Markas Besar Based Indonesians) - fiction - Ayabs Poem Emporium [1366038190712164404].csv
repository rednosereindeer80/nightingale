Men seek what they cannot acquire
When they beg, they are answered with a silent choir. 
And hardship is all they give with no remorse
Always giving us enough, but a  full course

Romance may not seek you now
But it is not a reason for you to cow
Don't doubt, for in every life lies beauty
Now go out and be happy, you cutie","",""

For Stonky

How can you look with such a proud stance?
Always moving without halting your advance?
Even if faced with such monsters,
You never let your stern face flee and wander.

How can you still fight with a smile,
Even when that face of yours wants to spit bile.
Depravity of mankind did not budge you,
As you held your belief as true.

What drove you to such madness?
With not even a hint of sadness?
An object of envy you are Stonky,
Now be yourself and always funky.","",""

Kartini Day


A Field of Defiance

A flower field left unattended,
Yet bloom they did, proud and splendid.
Growing might not depended,
Graceful with the breeze of wind as life intended.

A flower field picked with cruelty,
Seeing their beauty as futility.
No remorse with unkind totality,
Satisfied with life's inequality.

Damnation towards those who are so brutal!
Damnation towards those who make it cruel, all!!
A beauty destroyed with no meaning, 
Ignoring the painful shriek of their screaming?!

How cruel could they be, seeing them as possessions,
How vandals are they? Do they not see their transgressions?
For they do not understand the price of their taking,
A world of power and freedom they are forsaking.

Yet as men walk unbothered,
The field of flowers grows unfettered.
Their strength is never-ending,
Even when lives bend them, they remain unbending.","",""

I wore my sorrow like a cloak,
Each breath I took, a bitter choke.
The mirror showed a hollow face,
A soul undone, devoid of grace.

In shadows deep, I made my bed,
With haunting thoughts inside my head.
My sins would whisper, pull me near,
And fill my nights with shame and fear.

They danced around me, cold and tight,
And stole my sense of wrong and right.
I lost the path, I lost the flame,
And bore the weight, but not the name.

A worthless heap, or so I thought,
Each dream I had was left to rot.
I drowned in guilt I could not flee,
And loathed the very shape of me.

No will, no purpose, just decay,
A flicker lost in lightless gray.
I envied joy, I cursed the kind,
No peace was left inside my mind.

But in the silence, soft and wide,
A light began to swell inside.
It spoke not loud, it did not shout,
But gently cast my demons out.

It didn’t cleanse me, didn’t blind,
Just taught me how to free my mind.
To wear my wounds, but not with shame,
To own my past and speak my name.

I’m not a saint, I’m far from pure,
But now I stand, and now endure.
Each scar I bear, a song, a chord,
A proof of pain I once ignored.

The dawn now breaks without demand,
It warms my face, it takes my hand.
And though my soul was once a war,
I walk in peace,
I fight no more.","",""

Gripping the loose salted wet earth of Herrans, an ocean smaller than the land surrounds. 
Fishermen throw their nets at the small sea, capturing fish for their life fee. 
The wind was faint-barely noticeable, yet it's cold still able.
 Gold of wheat and green of grass mix but not blend, with ocean blue reflecting the sky of man. 
No rue in heart as calm settled in place, with no quickened breath of uncomfortable pace. 
How remorseful such a view will be blasted by bits, and accompanied by sounds of taints.","",""

Repost form chillchat 

Cupid's arrow lies dormant in his quiver for your fairness alone has stricken me to the core.

My body shivered when thou bestowed your presence on me. Your goldilocks noodles shine as if threads of gold are crafted by Hephaestus himself.

With questioning eyes, my gaze can only dart to you, as if your beauty has enchanted me not looking to the world I'm chained to.

Burning with passion, torrid heart in pain looking from afar as if you are an angel no mere mortal can approach.

How long must I wait, holding this emotion, boiling emotion, filled with desires and love?

My faith in you alone beholden me, as your grace alone can make the angel cry in jealousy and contempt.

Please, madam; receive my love, as your fairness alone is worth a thousand chances.

Oh Pangsit, you are the greatest beauty the world has ever seen!","",""

My proudest poem

It's nice to talk. 
Watching the birds go and flock .
Why complain now? The ticking sound just starts in your clock.
All the thing you've done is but a Prologue.

Do be still, look, and gaze. 
Look, at the small. 
Don't be mournful of your life, be grateful for its days.
Nothing yet colors your hall. 

Stand and ready to defy your sorrow. 
Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go hollow.","",""

Save–save me from such pain and toment as my life went down with nothing to recover. A hole i want to say exist but a hole already filled with such hatred that none can replace.

I sometimes reminisced about it, more often than I want, more often than I like. When all you have is so painful, it amounts to nothing, no matter how hard you try to find meaning for those silent days. What can you do but remember, imagine that wanderlust you've lost, so long ago discarded by pain and suffering, what essence is man but to endure, but as you endure, you've lost something in you and gained new ones. 

Often, however, I want to be me before the change, before my mind plays tricks on my head.","",""

The sky lit with arrows, and men, women, children—all fell before my eyes. I remembered it. I remembered the helplessness I felt. I remembered the horrifying terror that gods have sent upon my kind. Their blood splatter the earth; bodies lay limp, children taken from their mother's arm.

In my mind: what sins have we committed to our gods to deserve such fate, what error that made the heavens rage upon my people? For them to abandon us without just, without reason?

M home, my family, my people, condemned! Their body paraded like thropies, their meat and their blood consumed.

My son—I remembered my son. He was screaming my name, screaming for help. I cant do anything—to see him die as his neck rolled down to my feet.

They are leaning on a wall, with the stars and moon above, with chils from the ocean's breeze that hits.

“No, it is not,” a rueful smile made by him, devious in nature, infuriating to look at. “It is not needed, I simply—simply want it to be. It is not like food or air, and others can make me laugh. It was simply what I like to do. Why do you ask?” He said, still looking up to heaven's creation.

“Because I want to know,” came her quick answer.

“Why do you want to know?” He followed

“Because that’s all I have.” Her forehead was flicked from her stupor, and she glared at her friend, not even giving him the pleasure of seeing her yelp.

“If that’s all you have, why not fill some of it with japes and laughter,” he chuckled slightly, “and not this uptight role you always have, it isn’t fun, you know, seeing you all broody in the corner while others cheer with beers in hand.”

“Your ideas of fun have no boundaries, you dolt. I am left to clean up your mess, and somehow you always get away with it,” she grimaced, touching the sting on her temples. 

He again laughs, this time flashing a smile towards her, his auburn beard and tunic were blown by the wind eyes half closed, and a thumb pointing at himself proudly. “No one can deny my charm, not even you, my grumpy friend. Well, almost everyone at least, I still haven't made that ba#tard Kiran laugh yet.” He grumbled.

It is her turn to laugh: “Someday you’ll make him laugh, I know so.”

“You know so? How?”

“Because you're Fingal MacCumhaill, a seer and a poet, a bard and a warrior, leader of the Fians, and most importantly: you are a clown that can even make fish pity you.”

“Hey! That’s not how…” he sighed, then snorted, “Thank…you, my friend”

As his daughter left, he sat on the left side of the hospital bed with his grandson, climbing onto hug him. He looked quite sleepy, and the outside looked as if the sun was just about to rise; no wonder the little guy is fighting to stay awake. While Derrick hasn’t felt this energized in decades, he could walk for hours outside with no end like he used to do.

They laughed and joked about the past. He noticed his daughter was calling his children one turn at a time, each looking at him with a weird face and then smiling at him as if nothing had happened, until it was his wife’s turn to be called by his daughter.

She looked. Why is his wife making that face? He has known her for decades, and he knows when something is bothering her. He was about to ask, but his sons and daughter just continued to distract him. He was about to ask again, and yet hours more they were distracted, until it was one last time, his eyes quite sleepy now, and he wanted to drink water, this time he wanted to speak once more, one final time, and all of them stopped their talk, looking at him as if there is a secret he don’t know.

He touched the face of his wife, and she nuzzled her face with tears in her eyes.

“Oh, I see,” he says, “I’m about to die, I see.” his wife just nodded; he could feel her tears running down his arm, her silence was all he needed. 

There was silence between them. He smiled and chuckled as his wife followed.

“I love you, Trisha,” those all he can say before the lords take him, and no answer he can hear back.

love is fickle that way, the more you love, the harder it is to let go, men and women, and in between invest time, energy, and emotion too much. One thing they sought was precious, and one day at random, they'll toss it like common garbage.  And sometimes the people don't change, you do. One love could be outgrown; there is still fondness there, somewhere, in your heart, but its sweetness covers the bile that slowly poisons your mind. love is in some way permanent; it could hold out and bloom into a beautiful flower illuminated by an orange sun, and the next turn into a fiery hate, but it is still love.

What is love anyway but a sense of wanting that never ends? What is love but a yearning for happiness from the heart that beats with whom you cherish? It is sadness, joy, rage, disgust, and more all into one.  To chase, to persevere:  all without reward, except their presence in your heart. Love is nothing and it is everything. It needs to be lustful,  a sense of pure nature present, but purity it must have; without purity, love is nothing more than an instinct. love is a concept that is beyond lust, but it must have lust.
