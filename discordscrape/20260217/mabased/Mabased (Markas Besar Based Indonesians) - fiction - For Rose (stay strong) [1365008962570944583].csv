It is sunny outside.

Everyone is asking if I was ok, fussing over me as if I was a newborn fawn. I wish I could scream at them to stop and just leave me alone. I couldn't do that; they’ll think I'm mad…mad. What a word isn't it,

God, why can’t the day just just go faster? I wanna go home and go to my room, why am I in school now.

She is gone. And me alone, with just, just dad.

What a fuked up situation
God, God ,God!!– WHY?!

Why, just why?

I just wanna stop and cry, i just wanna be normal, why can i have a… it's just that i… I can't remember it all anymore, I just blocked it i think. Yeah, that is right, there's nothing I could do except… No  I can't, I can’t be like this, I can't be like… her, I can’t…. I miss her. I miss her so much…. Why did you leave me? Why did you? I'm alone, I have no one but myself, not sure there is probably family out there but it's just me now, and only me.

In the choking grip of grief, words went meaningless compared to silence, memories, those dam memories flooded in. Her death, her death like that, not in some sickness, she was strong for too long, I wished, I wished I could do something I wished I had known. Dam, this…

# Why can't I do anything!!


After all that hell, those hollow stares, suffocating pity, drowned by the weight of silence and eyes they don’t understand and never will. I am not some smoke that vanishes by the slight breeze: I will rage, I will cry, I will ache, but I won't fall like her. Her story might end buried way too soon and the voices of pain and its ghost may be too much.

And yet with everything I've gone through this week, almost everything that drove me mad, things that have stressed me out to the point of illness.. I will make one thing clear, a promise I made once I reached the age enough to understand my story.
