do you think that the moon is in love with the sun and wishes she were a planet so she could orbit the sun but she's stuck orbitting earth
and earth is getting more and more toxic than he used to be  earth isn't the same as he was when they first were linked together","","👍 (1)"

love is fickle that way, the more you love, the harder it is to let go, men and women, and in between invest time, energy, and emotion too much. One thing they sought was precious, and one day at random, they'll toss it like common garbage.  And sometimes the people don't change, you do. One love could be outgrown; there is still fondness there, somewhere, in your heart, but its sweetness covers the bile that slowly poisons your mind. love is in some way permanent; it could hold out and bloom into a beautiful flower illuminated by an orange sun, and the next turn into a fiery hate, but it is still love.

What is love anyway but a sense of wanting that never ends? What is love but a yearning for happiness from the heart that beats with whom you cherish? It is sadness, joy, rage, disgust, and more all into one.  To chase, to persevere:  all without reward, except their presence in your heart. Love is nothing and it is everything. It needs to be lustful,  a sense of pure nature present, but purity it must have; without purity, love is nothing more than an instinct. love is a concept that is beyond lust, but it must have lust.

holding his hand, caressing his hair, and more--- so much more. scandalous and cute, oh naivety and pragmatism come to dance, producing a waltz that seems to never end, yet end it must!

oh love, oh **LOVE**, how dazzling it is for some to be blinded.","",""

to fght for its exixtence is toture for the soul
