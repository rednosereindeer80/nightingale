An image so strong; the minds always wander to a faraway place, ignoring life's sonder.
Oh, ignorant, childish dream that I have; oh, how painful to bear, how rejoiceful to have.
I want to be at that yonder place, where pain and suffering have no chance.
This thing I have, this curse I have, so relenting to hold, so tormenting to have,

Ignore, ignore, ignore, that painful thing.

Ignore, ignore, that baleful thing.

That thing over there lurks and always haunts

Please, please, please help me from this pain, please, please help me from this torment.
One step, two step, steps after steps after step.

It is here in my mind, it's here in my mind.


I hear, oh i hear, that dream, so beautiful, so mean!!


Now—now look,  look, and look as that dream made me forget the here and now.","",""
