|| ||
**It's 2012. The ex Novalian state of Ikkrastan went through some chaos after passing a liberal and progressive bill, and it angered the ummah of Mursyiddists there, especially on the east. A civil war broke out and lasted for 2 years between Jihadists vs the Democratic government.**

**Months before the civil war ends in 28 August of 2014, the Glavna Željeznica za Opskrbu Države, known as the GLAŽOD railway was destroyed in the city of Al-Dhahab. More than a thousand of casualties was said to be dead. The Jihadists hadnt reached the city, and for that reason, the exiled Uzur workers were blamed. It spreaded to ethnic Barsistanis, thus police forces began to crack down Uzurs.**

**The act of killing by shooting by the police force gained alot of controversy. The Uzurs revolted. 28 August of 2014, the Mursyiddist State of Ikkrastan was formed, in the eastern side of formerly Republic of Ikkrastan. Just 2 months after that, on 4 Novemeber 2014, the ""Uzur Railway Republic"" was proclaimed after separatst movements by ethnic Uzurs in the city of Al Dhahab and cities close to it.**

**Just months later, on 15 April 2015, after the debate with the right wing government and the social democratic party, to avoid conflict, the Ikkra government lets the social democratic north to secede from the republic. Ikkrastan has been divided into 4 parts......**","",""
