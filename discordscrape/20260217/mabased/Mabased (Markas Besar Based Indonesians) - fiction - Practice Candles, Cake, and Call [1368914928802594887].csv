Miss Khalifa keeps her eyes ajar, pupils dilated by the dim. The siderails cage her safe in place, embraced by the soft, white bedsheets. If only the nurses had linked her to a monitor, she might be able to express her racing heartbeat to the nobody-else-inside.

The old lady begins to smell the gentle scent of burning candles. What cake will they bring? Chocolate? Cheese? Even a cupcake will be revolutionary. Miss Khalifa can already taste the tempting sweetness, fingers crossed. In a few minutes, she expects friendly faces to open that door and wish her the best. But her strength has decayed ever since she rang 112. She cannot show a smile—not anymore—let alone blow some candles. Perhaps, it will be young Anwar’s duty instead, the son of her youngest daughter. Oh, how she misses driving her to school, then to college, then to work. Now, that woman has both private vehicle and residence under her name, Riska. Her sweet voice repeats in her aged ears.

""Mother! Mother,"" she would call.

But at last, midnight has arrived. With the last bit of power in her body, Miss Khalifa shifts her gaze to the door. It creaks open. Light rushes in. And there she stands. A nurse; a stranger to her.

Alone.

When the hallway’s beam reaches the old lady’s eyes, they do not reflect stars. They do not constrict.
