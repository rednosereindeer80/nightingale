**In 1921, following the Soviet victory of the Polish-Soviet war after Hans von Seeckt staged a conflict with Poland and partitioned it between the Soviets. The politics of the Weimar Republic went instable after Hans von Seeckt refused to recognise the Leauge of Nations mandate for Poland. Due to the political chaos, the Soviet Union invades Germany. However, due to the effectiveness of the Freikorps on eliminating German communists, the Soviet Union had a harder time on the operation. The British Empire began to secretly contact the Reichswer on plans of arming up against the Soviet Union.**

**The Soviets had reached Berlin, however the Reichswer countered back against the Soviet Union, until the Treaty of Stockholm was signed, forcing Germany to give east Prussia and Eastern Silesia, leaving the Soviet Union without reparations.**","",""

> It is 1917. The Bolsheviks had taken over much of the soul of the Russian fatherland, with the white army resisting the Bolshevik expansion of their ideas of Communism. By the Russian Civil War, Vladimir Lenin had a goal, to spread the revolution to Europe. Now as of 1920, the Soviet-Polish War broke out after the nationalists of Poland, led by Josef Pilzsudski, advanced throughout the Belarus and the Ukrainian plains. Since 1919, the Red Army had been battling the Polish nationalists and finally, in 1920 the Red Army counterattacked after battles on Kyiv and West Belarus. However, problems start to occur as doubt circles the Red Army, and with that, the head of the Red Army, Leon Trotsky, contacted the Reichswer to stage a conflict with Poland, in return they could gain the former East Prussian territories. The conflict happens on the 21st of August 1920, as Hans von Seeckt steamrolls across the former German land.

> After the invasion of Poland, the Reichswer refuses to recognise the sovereignty of Poland under the mandate of Leuage of Nations, and thus revolts plunged since January of 1921, as theyve opposed against the Reichswer and the Freikorps. Due to the effectiveness of the Freikorps, they hadnt been abandoned in favour of securing the Weimar Republic from communist uprisings, especially in the Ruhr and Saxony. With the underestimation of the Red Army on Germany's political instability, the Soviet army advanced towards the northern plains of Germany with Operation October that was launched on **5th of May 1921**, swifting through East Prussia and the large industrial sectors of Silesia in just a few months.

> The progress of the Soviet advance towards the industrial heart of Europe was stunted after successful counteroffensives by the Reichswer in Berlin. Since communists were purged, the Soviet offensives failed as logistics were on thin ice, and the Reichswer counters the Red Army with the secret help from the allies by armaments.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1395042059852840960/1448694111472189471/Screenshot_775.png?ex=69967fc7&is=69952e47&hm=70931db83efc533d09c786cb64d208d0cf6f2828e868140be3e11c8c44e30cbd&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1395042059852840960/1448694112034492436/Screenshot_777.png?ex=69967fc7&is=69952e47&hm=40bb8ecd29ea77b57613da1aedb090fe2ccb03fba8dea4b436d17ba40cbe825f&",""

> The collapsing front of the Soviets caused their efforts to plunge inside of Germany. The Red Army suffer losses after the more severe implementation of War Communism by Vladimir Lenin, focusing on taking the grains for the advances of the Red Army. At the midst of 1921, the Red Army had been collapsing on the German front, and the Reichswer oversaw advances of theirs towards the occupied lands of Germany. Though after battling for months, Operation October has been put into an end after both factions negotiated for a peace in Europe, and for Europe, after the war that costed their manpower and logistics.

> Before the treaty would lead them to a peace, the Reichswer had control over most of Danzig, battling in the city of Poznan and stalemate has been put under the lines across East Prussia and Silesia. To put an end into the conflict, the LoN issued a treaty to be signed on the capital city of Latvia, Riga. As a neutral baltic nation that serves as a buffer between communism and western powers, both sides negotiated under the resolution of the LoN on Riga. The Treaty of Liga was signed on **30th of November 1921**, with the conditions of:

- The Socialist Republic of Poland, the Socialist Republic of East Prussia would become sovereign states, and satelite states to serve as a buffer zone between Germany and Soviet Russia
- Northern side of Silesia would have its own sovereign republic under the name of the Socialist Republic of Silesia with means of stabilising industrial possession between two nations
- Both sides will pay reparations for all of the damages and this involves Germany's involvement in WW1
- Germany gives up East Prussia and the northern side of Silesia (referred to the establishments of Socialist Republic)
