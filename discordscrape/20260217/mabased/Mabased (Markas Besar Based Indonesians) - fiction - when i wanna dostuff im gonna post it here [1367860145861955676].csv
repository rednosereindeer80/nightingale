The Empire has very clearly violated our rights. Our Eastern Frontier was seized with extreme violence, blood spilt for nothing more than a show of force. And now they seek to seize our eastern colonies too? For the greater good of the federation, and of the entire human race, violations as dire as this musn't be left unpunished. So I hereby declare a state of emergency. I believe you all know what comes next. I speak from the balcony of the Union Palace on Nova Terrae. As you all may have known, both our upper and lower houses have allowed for the immediate mobilization of our armed forces, both with an overwhelming supermajority. This morning, at exactly 10:00, Central Terran Time, we have sent a transmission from our Eastern Command Headquarters to the occupying Imperial Forces in Marches IV, the transmission stated, quite simply, that if they do not begin the withdrawal of their military assets from our territory and are willing to open diplomatic talks regarding reparations for the massacres at Marches, Merlin, and other occupied territories, a state of war will exist between us. Their response? Dead silence and the capture of our last friendly military installation in the Eastern Frontier. I need not say more. As of noon, 05-03-2117, The United Federation Of The Terran Republics is at war with The Throne At Salazar and any and all allied Imperial States and/or factions.*

*2117, On The Precipice Of War.*
```Winterflame, The Capital Of The Merlin System.
The second most populated planet in the Eastern Frontier. 
On the morning of a otherwise normal day, Battle Group Seven of the Third Imperial Fleet, consisting of 13 destroyers, two heavy cruisers and the Malevolent-class battleship Konigsberg. 
The Eastern Frontier, whilst consisting of around two dozen systems only had 5 fully colonised systems. The region was guarded by the newly founded 11th Fleet, under Admiral Juno Hauptmann, a war hero of the earlier Black Gold Campaign. Even with Adm. Hauptmann's knowledge and experience, even she could not fight against the impending storm.```","",""

*A brief introduction to the Young Triumvirate.*

```
..the combined invading fleet is lead by three young officers, Rear Admiral Mikhail Tchaikovsky, Rear Admiral Castrop Von Streiss, and interestingly, Commodore Sigmund Streit.
Together, they are known as the Young Triumvirate. Why? Because they, as of right now, are the ones with the highest chance of joining the Imperial High Command. It is quite obvious that whoever wins, or is most successful in this campaign, will win the Kaiser's favor and replace the aging Admiral Kempff in his position as Admiral of the 3rd Fleet.
While most of you may already know who these people are, we will quickly provide a profile of who each of them are.

Rear Admiral Mikhail Tchaikovsky, considered by some to be the most orthodox choice out of the three, is a skilled and orthodox strategist. One of the highest graded graduates from his class, he graduated the prestigious Brontus Military Academy. A Third Fleet-er from his commissioning, he has fought in both the Lamplight War and the Stahlberg Affair. He was chosen to lead the Third Fleet's Third and Second Task Forces, making his part of the fleet the largest amongst the three young flag officers.

Read Admiral Castrop Von Streiss. Nicknamed "" The Bane Of All Pirates "", he was formerly a part of the infamous Fifth Fleet. His abilities and sheer experience would probably have gotten him the position of Fifth Fleet Vice Admiral, but he was transferred to the Third Fleet right before the First Battle Of Merlin. You might think, "" Why would they choose someone from what is basically a policing fleet? "". Do not be mistaken, during their anti-piracy operations, combat was practically a daily activity for members of the Fifth Fleet, especially for Von Streiss. 

Before we tell you about the famed Sigmund Streit, Wielder of the Konigsberg, there is something you should take note of.
The Vice Admiral, of all peoples, is vehemently against the Commodore's Assignment.```","",""

The fires have died, and we await a response from The Federation.
The armrest of my chair is cold, and so are the barrels of our guns, yet here I am, aboard the bridge of my ship, still stationed hundreds of thousands of feet above the surface of Winterflame. We fought in other parts of the system, sh-t, we assisted in driving them out the region entirely. But always, after every battle, we were ordered to dock above Winterflame. Always *above.* If not for the on-board shuttle, I would have never touched the surface of Winterflame.

I wondered why, and I wish I haven't.

"" Captain, its time. ""

F-ck me. 
Its always the clean, formal-written books that get to you. 
*""On the supression of rebellious elements""* or the classic, *""The Summation Of The Vetus Doctrinae""*
Hundred year old bullsh-t that that arse still adheres to, imagine what would happen if Tchaikovsky was to use those tactics during Stahlberg! 
But orders are orders.
I remember the string of commands I was briefed to say, I say them quickly. 
The target? A ice-mining colony on the northern ice cap, which happened to hold a resupply depot for Federation ships. 
Seven, five, four, three, you get the gist of it.
A single coordinated salvo from my ship, my sister cruiser, the *Konigsberg* and of course, the f-cking *Plutarch's Blade.*
Thats that, I guess. 
If we weren't already at war, this is our declaration.","",""
