"776844764770861127","snuckel4","2025-03-08T21:21:08.6570000+00:00","*Indonesia's lack of global ambition is a significant weakness that prevents it from becoming a true international power. While countries like China, India, and even smaller nations such as South Korea aggressively expand their influence through diplomacy, economy, and culture, Indonesia remains largely passive. It prefers to focus on domestic stability and regional affairs rather than taking bold steps on the global stage. This reluctance to assert itself internationally makes it an afterthought in major geopolitical decisions, reducing its bargaining power and limiting opportunities for economic and diplomatic advancements.  

Without a clear vision for global leadership, Indonesia struggles to attract foreign investment, influence international policies, or establish itself as a cultural and economic powerhouse. It has the population size, natural resources, and strategic location to be a dominant force, yet it lacks the drive to capitalize on these advantages. Other nations actively shape global narratives, whether through media, technology, or diplomacy, while Indonesia remains reactive rather than proactive. This passive stance not only weakens its international standing but also hinders its long-term economic and political potential.  

By failing to develop a strong international presence, Indonesia risks being left behind as other emerging economies continue to grow. It needs to push for more assertive foreign policies, strengthen its global partnerships, and actively participate in international discussions beyond ASEAN. Without ambition and strategic vision, Indonesia will remain a regional middle power rather than a true global influencer, limiting its ability to shape its own future in an increasingly competitive world.*","",""
