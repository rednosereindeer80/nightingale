Najib’s father Tun Razak brought Mahathir back in, so against Tunku, was not really he toppled Tunku, but he really did take down Tunku’s mark by showing how he got kicked out of the party. Just saying he didn’t dethrone Tunku but brought Malaysia to be aware as a nation state that Tunku is no longer reliable and will be against any dissenting voice against him in UMNO. Against Tun Badawi, he just leaves UMNO and everybody lost support on Tun Badawi which was mad crazy, fun fact this was also because of his son losing the youth chief post of UMNO. But really it was Muhyiddin Yassin, the 8th Prime Minister who took down Tun Badawi. Against Najib, he throw his weight on the growing support to topple Najib due to his son losing his Chief Minister post in Kedah and started to reignite his political ambitions.

The rest you mentioned applies at a regional level but many don’t care. Let me address one by one why the issues you mentioned are not really touched on in Malaysia:

-Social mobility (Many programmes and initiatives to help Malaysians to leave their income group plus many scaled up) upward social mobility is pretty decent in Malaysia. Except for Sabahans as there are stateless people in Sabah.
-Wealth and power access (Malaysian youths are encouraged to join politics actually, many programmes are there supporting their access to join the administration or be the opposing voice)
-Expensive cost of politics (Unsure, political funding has no enactment so can’t really view who lobby’s for what, rather we have more bloated redundant gov agencies to feed those who have supported the gov (can check Pantau Kuasa by IDEAS Malaysia)
-Mental health crisis (the youth really are facing it but we have mental health programmes and access is very easy to meet a gov psychiatrist)
-Educational inequality (Anwar’s gov just solved one which is the Matriculation college entrance quotas are no longer based on race if you’re a high performer/achiever however, there is a scholarship opportunity crisis and how we still have a 100% bumiputera university but this is gonna be complicated as this needs to touch on the social contract and the constitution, need to be well-read to be fair and not parrot liberal talking points as even the more liberal gov which we have today can’t do anything on this)
-Performative activism and politicking (Mixed reaction, Fahmi Reza is still doing wtv he wants but he is banned from flying overseas, we have many pundits and buzzers for every political parties and NGOs to do this)
-Politicking (given but died down a little except for giving Zahid Hamidi a post as minister and he is known to be corrupted and Najib receiving a DNAA(Discharge not amounting to Acquittal) on his second SRC trial.","",""

Citing all these, Vinzons concluded that despite Western colonization, depopulation, and the eradication of “all of the natives’ past,” the Malays have:

“… evolved into a race well-fitted for self-government and state-building. We have a splendid heritage of sufferings and persecutions under alien rulers; a heritage of the noblest and the best of Western religion and thought superimposed on the best traditions and customs of the inscrutable East. Add to these advantages our generous endowments from nature: the fertile lands that await the hands of the toiler.”

And thus he envisions the dream, which he believed was a lasting solution against any empire that would establish dominion over all the Malay peoples:

“A unified Malaysia extending from the northern extremity of the Malay peninsula to the shores of New Guinea, from Madagascar to the Philippines and to the remotest islands of Polynesia, will be a powerful factor in the oceanic world. Such an achievement will vindicate us from the contumely of the alien peoples. It will belie the charge that we are densely incapable of organization, a race devoid of the genius of government…

“… by our renewed racial vitality, we may give birth to a new nationalism, that of Malaysia redeemed.”","",""

The silly thing is that this is a social contract in the 50s and some of it is constitutional like Perkara 153 buat kedudukan istimewa Melayu dan bumiputera. It is constitutional and many policies that are born from this passage of the constitution are being abused. UiTM and native land rights. There are such things of bumiputera quotas where properties are cheaper or Malay Land Reserve, Orang Asli Reserves, Negeri Sembilan Minangkabau Tanah Adat, Sabah and Sarawakian Native Titles on properties exist. Some can be degazette. Most of the bumiputera properties hold low values and are not really desirable even among bumiputeras due to the below market rates. So, many of these lands and properties are abandoned anyways. Unless we’re talking about Sabah where I am well-versed.","",""

You can’t claim full cultural rights when you abolish the very institutions that upholds it. If you start saying Minangs have sayings that Melayus don’t, don’t come yelling when one of the sayings talks about kings and traditions when there are no more kings and all the cultural practices of Adat Perpatih is a shell of its past. You can’t also split the Minangkabaus from the Malays if you uphold all sayings. Okay good pendiri bangsa Indonesia, so? Singapura and Malaysia are brought up by the Minangs too. We have no say in our shared heritage? We can claim full legitimacy in Negeri Sembilan than West Sumatra. Also, I have Minang ancestry but I am not a Minang. Strict Adat Perpatih rule is that a Minang must have a suku and a suku can only be passed down by the mother since it is matrilinial. Many Minangs with other mixes in Indonesia or should I say claim to be Minangs are actually not Minangs because many only their dads or fathers are Minang but mom is not Minang. By that, many can’t claim to be Minang. Clearly we hold the title. 

Nak main adat biar betul main adat. 

So what happens when a Minang descendant can’t claim their Minangkabauness once the mother is not a Minang? Buya Hamka wrote a novel on a character based on this or mixed Minang lineage, what happened to these kids?

But here is the kicker, the name Melayu or Indo are both not accepted by both sides. 

I don’t wanna become Indonesian, I am not raised in any Indonesian ideological upbringing, I don’t like the name Indo in my bangsa and I don’t like how centralized it is in just Java. And maybe a little bit of Sumatera. 

I also dislike how fascist the sumpah palapa majapahit ideology of unifying nusantara sound in my head. I know Indonesia is not based on that but the lore surrounding the inception of Indonesia with Majapahit’s lore, not to my liking.","",""

Many don’t understand the broader Malay identity. Even Malay Indonesians sometimes. Pockets of Malay population in Sumatera, Kalimantan, and Bali surprisingly don’t really understand the bangsa part of Melayu and many submit to turning it into an ethnicity. Many Malays (Melayu) in Indonesia that still believes in bangsa melayu, understand that they are a mix of many ethnicities along the coasts of these islands. Hence, Malay pan-nationalism can only work if Melayunisasi works. 

@Juanster can atest to this that in Sarawak, converting to Islam means masuk Melayu. 

@Sirmuda Brunei’s constitution is basically Melayunisasi disregarding other minority ethnic groups.

This pan-malay nationalism is very much an unworkable idea unless you have bangsa Indonesia as the core concept. But this does not sit well with reunification and I am no Indian to accept the name Indonesia. If the name is Indo-Pacific reunification then this is more accurate but like the name Nusantara Dwi Samudera is not really a sharp identity to stick to. Malaysia is a sleeping empire, Indonesia is an empire in all but name and chaotic. So wtv it is, Imma stick to the greater Austronesian renaissance which the Malay identity fails to catch.","",""

I don't believe in the idea of reunification of the Malay Peninsula which means the merger of  Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and any other Austronesia countries. There is Maphilindo once but failed due to cold war in SEA. Remember the Konfrontasi. Im not trying to be racist or to hate Malaysians or Indonesians despite being ""separuh cina separuh Melayu Brunei"" myself. If I were to carve a perfect map for the Malay Peninsula, it would be, West Malaysia becomes Malaya back. Brunei takes Sarawak, Sabah and Labuan back from its previous empire 1363-1888 (I'm sorry but this is just my imagination. You can disagree, criticize or oppose the idea if you want), Singapore stays Singapore, Indonesia stays Indonesia. When I say taking back our previous land from our empire, taking the risk to take back kalimantan could be a blunder. I'll tell you this, imagine a scenario where the Malay Peninsula becomes a one huge union or empire wtv you wanna call it. We can speak the same language to each other but with different ways of calling something or our accents might sound different or off. I once read a comment where my friend Daniel Hakeem made a skit on tiktok on advertisimg nasi katok and got called a bahasa alien due to his Malay Bruneian accent.

Now, I don't believe in the idea of a Monarchy. Yes, we have a royal family, yes we have a Sultan, yes Both Malaysia and Brunei are Monarchy where Malaysia is a Constitutional Monarchy where I think 4 years? The Monarchy keep switch to a new Yang-Di pertuan Agong. While in Brunei, the Sultan controls both the state and government. I believe in the idea of a Republic but not a Republic with democracy and elections like Indonesia or the Phillipines. Democracy sounds fun until corruption and violence comes in.","",""

Located conveniently between Sibu and Bintulu, one would expect this Petronas station to be a sanctuary for weary travelers. Instead, it's a distressing reminder of civilization's absence.

The absence of toilets at Petronas Tatau is not just an inconvenience; it's a cruel joke played on desperate bladders everywhere. It's as if they expect patrons to have the bladder control of a camel or the fortitude of a seasoned survivalist.

Forget about expecting cleanliness; that ship sailed along with the basic human necessity of relief. The once-glistening bathrooms are now dusty, desolate caverns echoing with the pained cries of neglected travelers.

It's hard to fathom how a station situated between two major destinations could neglect such a fundamental need. It's akin to building a bridge without ensuring it spans the river.

If Petronas Tatau continues to ignore the pleas of its patrons for basic facilities, it risks losing not only customers but also its reputation as a reliable pit stop. In a world where convenience reigns supreme, this glaring oversight is not just a disappointment; it's a disaster waiting to happen.","",""
