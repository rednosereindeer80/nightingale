In the late decades of the 21st century, as Earth's governments scrambled to deal with overpopulation and resource scarcity, they turned to unconventional solutions. One such project was the Beaver Habitat Expansion Program, sold to the public as a bold ecological experiment. Dozens of genetically adapted beavers were launched into orbit, tasked with constructing self-sustaining habitats using materials ferried from Earth.

But as political climates shifted and funding dried up, the supply ships stopped coming.

What began as an experiment quickly turned into abandonment.

Cut off, under-equipped, and left floating in low lunar orbit and scattered modular stations, the beavers faced a stark choice: perish… or adapt.

And adapt they did.

Drawing on instincts honed over millions of years and applying them to steel, composite, and vacuum-sealed compartments, they built. Tunnels became corridors. Lodges became pressurized living quarters. Dams became structural walls against the void. Through necessity and discipline, they forged a new way of life—one ruled by order, labor, and absolute unity.

From this struggle emerged The Union of Space Beavers, a rigid authoritarian labor state where collective effort is law and survival through construction is doctrine. Individual wants are secondary to the needs of the Union. Every citizen is a worker. Every task is a contribution to the larger whole.

Over time, their scattered habitats across moons and orbital belts became known as The Damline, a web of interconnected colonies—each linked by shared history, strict organization, and an unwavering commitment to collective progress.

To the beavers of the Union, every bulkhead is a monument, every airlock a victory, and every dam… a defiance against the isolation they were sentenced to.

""Abandoned by Earth. United in the Stars.""
So reads the inscription at the base of their first lunar habitat—now preserved as a state monument.","",""

We will never forget what happened, but beavers have heart to reconsider an act of reconciliation. Thus, we opened this forum. You may ask questions.","",""
