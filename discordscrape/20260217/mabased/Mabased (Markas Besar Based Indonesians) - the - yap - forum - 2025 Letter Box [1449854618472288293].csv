I'll speak OOC.

2024 was a shit year for me. Many things that were built up from 2019 all crashed down in 2024 and let's just say I lost myself. At the same time I was working on the Based(less) Indonesian Show, I allowed myself to be fully consumed by my Buzzer persona as a way to hide myself from my life being essentially in shambles. Everyday was an adventure, a quest, but every night was lonely, and I find myself doing next to nothing in the weekends. I lost faith in myself, and other people. Politics was stressful and isolating, knowing vast amount of information and leverage but having no power to do anything. Some people even tried to connect with me but I pushed them away because I thought I didn't have much to offer. Many people would say 2024 was a payoff and where my career rise, but I'd say there's a side that they don't see is me struggling mentally.

But that was two years ago, and it is to provide context to 2025. This year was the year I was slowly reclaiming my life outside of being Buzzer, and rebuilding a sense of identity outside of being that one nameless political shitposter and working around the realm of politics. I began cultivating newer friendships with people, going into their world, trying to open up my heart again with no avail but it doesn't matter, cause in the end anyone can be the right person, you just don't want to settle with them. And I started discovering new interest and hobbies, I started horsebacking, golfing and other things. If you looked, 2025 might be a slow year on the outside for me, but it was because I was struggling to restore what sense of identity I had after losing so much of it last year. It doesn't help that during 2024-2025 I was fighting off depression and thoughts I didn't want to speak of.","",""
"605452468284817427","buzzer9229","2025-12-17T04:38:21.2000000+00:00","2025 was also the year my faith in people are restored. I begin to appreciate the friends around me who helped me in my times of need, even forgetting themselves when I need help. I begin to appreciate their perspective. I seek out newer friendships, opening up myself to others and newer experience. Sometimes I find myself disappointed at people, but ultimately it is because I expect things too much from people at times, and it isn't fair if I treat them different because my expectations are high. People are people.

In my need to focus on people, I begin to invest much of my attention on the shaping of the Mabased community, an ecosystem between different creators and creating new friendgroups. And now life seems to be a bit more enjoyable than the barren times I've spent in 2024.

Next year will be a lot more different though. I've set my eyes for bigger things in 2026. I promise myself that in 2026 I'll try to reclaim much control of my life by doing what I actually want to in life, pursuing my dreams of getting masters or getting accepted as a Diplomat, rediscovering love, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

I've spent too long hiding from love, hiding from challenges, and keeping myself shielded from the dynamics of life. I know sooner or later I must level up and improve my life. And I have no one to put me accountable but myself. I'm not going to write down specific resolutions of what I want to do, I don't think it matters that much to me but the bigger picture. But I'll know I'll fail if by the end of 2026, I still feel the same. It will be worse like that than feeling like I got into a worse place than I started, because atleast I know that I tried atleast.

# Konco’s letter

*I’m not good with letters or writings. But I’ll try my best to address my thoughts and comments here.*

> I’ve only been active in this server ever since the mod team were more established, which was February this year, but holy shit, all of this felt so much longer. I also used to be active in content creation with Rawpinions, but as much as I try to do it forcefully, I wasn’t as happy as i thought it would be. So I decided to help out @Buzzer beneran with his channel and his community. I did make some videos there but i kinda stopped because i lack the discipline and thought for the content, plus I was pursuing other jobs as well, so ai focused on the community. 

> I’ll admit, there are times where I wanted to quit on this place and just be at peace given how chaotic this place could be. Tbh I don’t know why I’m still here or why buzz still trusts me to be here. But I guess there are some people here that made it so hard to leave. This community has become something that i’m proud to serve of. I get that I can get overly-strict or seem as if I’m a typical “discord mod” and shit. For that I’m sorry. 

> I wanna thank the team @Dewan Kepemimpinan @Dewan Pengurus that worked alongside me. We’ve gone through shit and yet here we are going for a second year for this server to grow. I’m sure there’ll be some interesting dynamics in the future for us. Be ready for 2026, because there might be some interesting shit later.

> To the @Kader (sorry for the tag). Buzzer’s loyal buzzers, the very thing that keeps MABASED alive. Sometimes y’all can be the most insufferable mofos, but most times, you can be the most reliable, trustworthy and even the most entertaining characters that discord could ever see. We’ve gone through shit together too. **the chat purges**, **the demonstration coordination**, we were also a part of **the night of the execution**. You were all there. Supporting Buzzer with his content and keeping this server alive. Thank you.

||I’ll thank those who were forced to leave here. If you can see this somehow… you made the year interesting.||

> In 2026, I hope to see more activity in the server and also maybe seeing more content of me in mabased hahah!

**Have a good year guys!**","","🔥 (6),❤️ (4),💪 (4),paham (3),10outof10 (2),⭐ (5)"

Honestly in my 8 years of working on, taking a part of, being simply a bystander nor a chatter in any discord community. 

I could say that this server gives more than every server and/or community i’ve been. Honestly its pretty funny that i started to getting close to this server and the people in it by literally in VC with @Konco (dude’s full of charisma and you can’t deny it) & @Lotso (with his shenanigans of jomok stuff and all that fun shit going + ELITE BALL KNOWLEDGE guy).

 I was about to treat it as some casual community that i oftentimes chatter in, but during the demonstration it really shows that this community matters, a lot.

Everyone took their part in, those who are on the field, in this community are all in for the  information and also tackling what could be misinformation for the better purposes, honestly its such a wild ride even that i took my part in out of belief that this is our time to act.

besides whatever happened with the outcome (tbh its sucks lmao) i really really appreciate and glad we are all in this part of space, conjoined by not just interests in politics but also bonds deeper more than what online spaces & communities could offer.

I really really never thought to put myself in atleast partaking nonetheless contributing for the betterments of this community, yet i somehow did? And it’s fucking great actually lmao.

I meet pretty much a lot of people that are really really supportive and also a really great friends to be considered, not just online “friends”, but actual friends. Depends on how u guys feel tho lol but i do feel we’re more than that.

Huge respect and all the thanks and love to the people of mabased community

The first time when I've entered Mabased, I had to admit: I was an ambitious and snobby user. Arrogance was one of my greatest mistakes as I stepped my foot here in Mabased. I believe in myself and my own knowledge that I can climb the ladders in order to become something greater, not knowing that I am, and still currently am: a small bird in a eagle's world. A prey that can be easily snatched without any leverage or influences. 

A few times I can still remembered where I had to be humbled, both in the server and real life experiences when I became overconfident in what I am doing. Humbled by the mods, humbled by other members who turned out to be experts than me (suhu/master as I like to called them). Other times I went too far with some of my jokes, forgetting the consequences of it, got Xed as a result.

Then I tried my best to act right, trying to fix myself in real life while knowing how much damages I've been causing to the server at some point. And for that, I do apologize once more to all of you for what I've did in this year. 

The last few months had not only taught me to be behave, to try to do more good, but to become more empathetic towards other people, rather than focusing on my own self interests. Many people here are actually bigger people than me, always reminded me that I am not a better person, I merely trying to be one.

I've joined pretty much almost all Buzzer bimteks, then dwelled into discussions to discuss topics with other members. Finally, being ranked as the number one most chronically online member inside Mabased (by xp), I've realized that I have a long way to go.","","😭 (2)"
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-19T07:28:25.3740000+00:00","All of this made me realized that I don't want to be in politics for positions. I am simply not suited for it, and I believe the current me is still a bad political candidate to even serve the people. All I can do now is to focus more towards what I am doing, enriching myself with experiences and connections. But even then, I questioned myself if I ever want to climb into politics, since right now: I am full of doubts.

Once more, to the mods and Buzzer himself, and towards all of the members: thank you for accepting me in inside this community, despite all of my wrongdoings and shenanigans. Thank you for accepting me out of goodwill, as I promise to try my best: to continue to behave better during the rest of the year, and for the next year. 

I've learnt so much from this server, so I will continue to stay in this server for the communities.","","❤️ (3)"

My god, where do I start? I only joined this server because I stumbled across Buzzer's show and thought ""haha i like your funny words, politic man."" and since I had no clue on politics or anything about it, be it Indonesian or not, I decided, hey! I'll just join his server! Surely it'd be educational! (well... it is! ....somewhat!)

Jk, it did teach me a lot of things about politics and how diverse it actually is, it also taught me a lot about society, about connections, about community. And it started to mean a lot to me. From the riots to just playing games, every moment here was truly an experience I would never get in any other server, it was so inspiring to meet so many people, and yet, I haven't actually met any of you irl yet! You make me feel so grateful to be able to live in a time where connecting with others has never been easier. I hope every minute in this server means as much to all of you as it has to me.

To be perfectly honest? If you were to tell me a few years ago if I wanted to join a sh**poster's political meme server filled with a bunch of dweebish guys, I'd probably run away from you.

But now? I'd do it again anytime 🩷 :smile: love you nerds

First off, I’ve got to give a massive shoutout to my buddy Jona. Your support through the chaos was priceless. You taught me the ropes of business and showed me how to sprinkle some fun into life! But, a little warning: diving deep into work made me a bit of a robot—I became cold-hearted and was ready to do anything, even if it meant others were hurting. Yikes!

Then came my rescue in the form of some incredible folks I met on Discord, in G-Lounge and Mabased. This crew taught me it’s perfectly okay to enjoy life. They helped warm up my ice-cold, profit-driven heart! Big love to Lotso, Buzzer, Konco, Indah, Arsenz, Lee, shibe, Adi, Jaxx, Jello, Kim, Lui, and all the rest. You all reminded me that friendship is about joy, not just transactions.

This year has turned into an epic adventure. Chatting and hanging out with all of you brought so much happiness back into my life. Sure, 2025 Zheng is still the workaholic and money-driven version of me, but thanks to you all, my trust issues are healing. And I finally realize it's totally worth taking a break to have some fun!

I've learned a ton, gained loads of new experiences, and yes, I’ve let my playful side out (trolling is part of the fun, right?). 

So, as I look ahead, here’s my advice to myself for the coming years: **Love and cherish everyone in your life. You don’t have to be a robot to reach for the stars!**

Much love to all of you at Mabased and G-Lounge! Thank you for everything, and take care!

I still remember how I read about this one certification that defines one as an elite in the industry. It was notoriously difficult, people said here and there they are failing the test multiple times. And meanwhile, man, even the certification syllabus makes no sense at all to me - a guy with no IT background.

Fast forward, this year in September, somehow, I nailed it in 1st attempt. It feels amazing, I can call myself an elite - lol.

Reality hits hard, though. Past couple weeks I have been trying to test my skills against real-world digital assets. Holy, it was so hard, feels like I am still a dirt-noob. This really humbles me alot.

but they say hard work pays off, and i felt like may 2025 was my peak. i made lots of friends, won 2nd place, and explored penang and KL with my friends. i felt like i was on top of the world.

after that though? i felt like life was extremely mundane. it was the same cycle, repeated over and over again. my mental state and productivity overall started to decline. to this day i am still disappointed with how this year ended off, i feel like a terrible person, and i truly hope 2026 will be a better year for me. i wish to try new things, be more productive, make a name for myself, maybe. but things take time, and i hope i will be able to power through this phase of my life 

thank you mabased for bringing laughs into my day, and a very special thanks to my boyfriend for sticking with me through thick and thin. although he'll have to return to jakarta soon, maybe when i visit him i can meet some of you guys as well :)

there was a lot of ups and downs: i broke up with my bf in the beginning of the year and lost a close friend immediately after, i had to move into an actual apartment and not a student housing, and i also lost my job (and in turn, my financial security). but i think i came out a lot stronger (cringe and overused i know), i got back with my bf, came out with really good grades and near perfect gpa, had more time to myself since im not working 3-4x a week overnights, and made so many more friends. more than what i lost. i guess the most significant change was that i started reading and writing again, both for fun and for educational purposes. 

i also joined a lot of communities this year, be it offline or online, and i find that it's quite fulfilling to talk to people, even if it's in a server full of shitposters and memers. getting to know strangers and making friendships is such a beautiful human experience and i really hope that i get to keep close the people dearest to me.

I never expect to found a community that I can actual be part of, and im happy, even if its too little to be acknowledged, im happy to be here. 
I hope you guys maybe can forgive how I act sometimes, we're all just a fleshy vessel with a Consciousness powerful enough to become a Civilization.

2025 being the year I joined this server was an interesting experience. I came here with not a lot of expectations, only to end up being very active. Nevertheless, I'm so glad to be here and my utmost sincerest thanks to the members who gave me a warm welcome here.

2025 has been a hard year for me, with lots of personal and health issues, especially mental health. I've been dealing with it since last year, and it's been hard lately. I've lost part of myself and many opportunities because of it. But, I'm slowly learning to live and find meaning in it again.

Even though i joined in 2024, i started to actively interact back in march 2025, iirc. Honestly, one of the nicer things of 2025 is interacting with you guys. This server keeps me occupied and distracted me from rough situations i'm dealing with. I met with wonderful people like Buzzer, Konco, Jax, Jazz, Indah, Lotso, Adi, Leon, Eden, Tuna, Ariga, Micin, Kleb, Max, Yukes, Nox, Green, Rose, Liz Kim, Arsenz, Lui, Shibe, Jello, Tian, Nox, Kikkou, Ayab, and others (that would take the entire night to list 😭) Through this server, i also have a wonderful opportunity to be a part of @G CAT G-Space community (the best part of 2025).

I also met with Pak Ustad @Ustad anarchy bukan bang toyib in Bandung, though briefly, and we didn't recognize each other, lmao. This solidified Mabased as part of my real life, too. I'm looking forward to meet and hangout with other members too 😁

Things in Mabased aren't always rainbows and sunshine, though. I have moments where I overshared or said some rude things, and I want to apologize for that. 

Lastly, I once again thank Mabased and its members for making this year much more bearable for me.

Thank you everyone, i'm looking forward to see y'all in 2026 🫡","","❤️ (8),⭐ (9),whug (5),🤝 (4),🐴 (2)"

On this letter, i joined this server at March of 2025, saying i wanna learn shi and... it's all too complicated, but it's nice that this community is... i gotta say, one of the most unique ones, one of the most secured ones, i thank @eden is busy | do not ping! , @Konco , @Lotso , @Ijo Khidr Midori von Chlorophyll , and Rose is not here, ive made friends here and well, it's a very diverse community im grateful off. The mods handled even to the lowest depths of the cave, rock bottom, like in September, and also an incident we... would like to not talk about.

Now, my wishes for the next year is for. @tian | , calm tf down, @Yuru-san , stop them zionist plots, and for everyone else, i hope you guys have a good next, and well though i would like to regard, despite a new and happy year, negative sides happen too. The crisis in Gaza and Sudan happens to this day, the collapse of the USSR in 1991 sparked wars and hard times for people in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and a lot of shenanigans happen that we shall remember.

As for now, im sorry for my writing but, i did learn things here, this server taught me on how to.... nothing honestly, or perhaps i forgot lmao but, thank you for accompanying, i will stay here, and well, thank you 2025, you were a big mess but we made alot of friends and memories from that. Id... adress new years on Russian later

I am grateful for all of you, grateful to be a part of this community, grateful to have met all of you. I have a stunted social life because of the circumstances of my health, it makes me sometimes ignorant of the whole wider world and how people think irl. I don't have many friends irl, I am quite recluse, but you guys made me learn, made me realize how ignorant I can be, realize how many stuff I have irl that must be fixed.

Im tearig up writting this, but thank you thank you so much, I can't put it into words, I dont have many place that I can savely talk about my condition and my prefrerence of the same sex, I don't have many place I know that can understand them. I was thinking of suicide this year, ive thought of it mutiple times and ive hurted myself, even tho I promised on the last attempt I wont do it again. Yet, I almost did it, amd you guys saved me, you guys saved me from that pit of hell.

I thanks, Liz, Jax, Yuru, Eden, Cisoc, Kim, Buzzer, Om Konco. Mak Eden, Ijo, Rose, Ripurr, Tian. KING JAZZ ""SMURFING"" HALO, Chello, Leon, Kikkou, mas Adi, Tuna, Ari, nox, Ustad, om Rawon, and even Stonky.

2025 hasn't been a particularly bad year for me apart from some financial difficulties. Apparently taking care of the house and my parents had hit me very hard financially.

Prior to whatever I do here and G-Space, I'm mostly a discord lurker, did not participate much, chill and just look at people interacting here and there. But idk man, something about Indonesian politics (once perhaps not a thing that I would touch with a 10 foot pole), basically *ragebaited* me into participation.

Turns out, I've gotten to know a lot of cool people in the discord community, I don't think I've ever met anyone irl yet but... Y'all seem like a cool bunch.

All of you have been a beacon of light in these trying times and man, what I get is that all y'all want to make Indonesia better.

Keep this up mabased! Keep up, all the political influencers here! Keep fighting for what you think is right and influence others to fight for a better Indonesia for all.

Lastly, *woof woof*, y'all have been lovely, here's to hoping we can be better this year,
