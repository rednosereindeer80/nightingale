I don't see a future going forward with this kind of government, especially with foreign investors prioritizing Vietnam, Thailand, and Phillipines- Indonesia is most likely heading towards a plateu in development and stagnation is the death of all nations, but my question is, what will happen going forwards?","",""

Something similar to what Xi Jinping did in 2012 could change this overnight, but further clean ups systematically would be necessary and frankly it all depends on how serious the government is at cleaning things up.","",""
