""AI Art sebagai Peluang atau Ancaman? Pengaruh Perception of AI Opportunity terhadap Existential Well-Being Digital Artist, ditinjau dari Subjective Job Insecurity""

although how skyrocket the usage of AI in last year, the research abt relationship between Perception of AI Opportunity and human behavior is still considered little in term of numbers and hence why i will try to contribute the digital artist point of view and hopefully encourage the ethical use of AI Art.

as Subjective Job Insecurity role for the mediator between the relationship, i'm curious on how Perception of AI Opportunity affect Existential Well-Being indirectly via Subjective Job Insecurity.

do you guys think this research is important to do? or is there any variable i could replace of? let me know your thought or curiousity","",""

or

""does the digital artists that know how to view AI Art as a tool and able to utilize it, affect that the state of digital artist to feel more valueable? that their existence had a meaning?""

both statement is the hypothesis i had in this topic, and if the data i collected later are accurate, that means X affect Y. 
Which can be a research further on how can we increase the Perception of AI Opportunity among the digital artists. Maybe legitimitation of artist rights would help? or AI that have digital artists consent increase the Perception of AI Opportunity itself","",""

why would anyone pay $200 for a human-crafted illustration when a machine vomits one up for pennies? Why commission emotion, skill, or vision when corporations can drown us in endless, hollow imitations? this isn’t just about artists starving. it’s about **culture rotting**. our games, our films, the stories we love, reduced to corporate slop, endlessly remixed, endlessly empty.

they call this the future? a world where every image, every frame, every melody is a cheap algorithmic knockoff? where beauty is measured in clicks, not craft? where the only thing thriving is the machine’s ability to mimic what it never feels?

AI should be a tool, not a replacement. a brush in the artist’s hand, not the corporate axe over their neck. But unless we fight back, unless we refuse to swallow this synthetic mediocrity, the damage will be done. The flood won’t stop. And we’ll all drown in the same derivative, algorithmically generated wasteland.

What I've observed was AI definitely kills translation jobs. Around 2020-2023, most of the translation jobs was only MTPE (Machine Translation Post Editing). In one document, It was like around 80% of the texts need to be translated manually by people. After MTPE, usually the amount of texts that needs to be translated reduced to only like 20%. So it was like 60% paycheck reduced for freelance translators.

Naturally, in recent years, MTPE jobs is also reduced in number as AI getting more advanced by being fed with feedback from MTPE.

Translation jobs was text-based, and AI has reduced the needs for the service significantly. Of course since AI now has ability to produce Image and Video, digital artists would feel threatened.","",""
