How do you see AI agent that are make average people like me who have zero knowladge in programming to be able to make my own software or web app ?","",""

My logic is : 

     Instead of building a machine from scrap/raw material, u purchase a processed one and use a guide to assemble it urself. Nothing wrong with that on my eyes.

     But when it comes to a far complicative machine, u either learnt how to craft it ur self or ask for professional service to make sure u didnt do mistake and ended up with loss.

     Dont focus to what people could do with AI, just improve ur self so u are getting better day by day.","",""

Better hire a lawyer before working with anyone or any company to be safe. But working with tech-related agencies that provides AI generation is an option. I came across a few advertisements but I don’t know if we could trust them yet because AI is still new. Better do your own research too not just ask Chat GPT hahaha","",""

So, yeah, you can actually build your web app, with zero technical background. Expect to face bugs though.

Just be sure to still do the clasic ol’ learning by doing. Learn security and optimizations

Those knowledges will help you fix bugs and further fine tune the web app code generated by the ai","",""
