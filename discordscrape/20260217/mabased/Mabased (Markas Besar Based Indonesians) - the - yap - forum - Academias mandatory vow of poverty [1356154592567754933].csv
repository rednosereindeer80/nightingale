These students of knowledge carry a heavy burden, and often, their journey begins with great hardship, especially in their sustenance (rizq).

In muslim academia, it is said that one of the ways Allah purifies the rank of scholars is by testing them through poverty… sometimes temporary, sometimes lifelong. Sufyan ibn Uyainah once said to a student of hadith, “Glad tidings—for when these ink pots enter the home, wealth leaves.” It’s a striking metaphor imo.

This vow of poverty, intentional or circumstantial, serves a divine purpose, which is to purify intention, preserve sincerity, and uphold the honor of the scholarly path.

Now, Do you think poverty is a necessary part of seeking knowledge? Can we preserve sincerity in an age of monetized knowledge (i.e those who study purely to make money from their credentials)?

Would love to see your thoughts on this","",""

Suffice to say, focusing yourself in the seek of knowledge while keeping your life being sincere and in poverty is one of the few methods to do so, yes. But here's the thing: it is not a prerequisite. Many early scholars throughout history were living under poverty not for the fact that they choose to be so, but mainly society never supported such aim for them through funding. Living in poverty while seeking through knowledge is a sign of vigilance for someone in their motive. From the lack of funding given to them, one can test if these scholars truly pursue knowledge above all.

This kind of practice is not really exclusive to Islam, but as a matter of fact, there are other instances where scholars practices the pursuit of knowledge through isolation, hermit like-lifestyle, etc. In Korea, during Joseon Dynasty period, scholars who are known as Seonbi were pretty famous for their strict code of conduct through living in modesty, as a few lives in countryside or rural areas, while others can live in forests. Mencius in ancient China emphasized that true scholar does not pursue wealth, but rather righteousness, along with other Confucian scholars. In ancient Greece, some philosophers such as Diogenes and Epictetus emphasized the idea of virtue rather than wealth. 

Thus from here, we know for a fact that the idea of living in modesty, even under poverty is not uncommon in some histories for scholars. But again, it is not an obligatory nor necessary part to find the idea of knowledge. What matters is how one navigate it, there’s a difference between earning a livelihood and commodifying knowledge purely for personal gain, as one could live in modesty, sometimes in better condition, yet still gain knowledge while advocating for it sincerely.","",""

How does one wish to spread knowledge and wisdom if he himself does not have the strength to do so, with hunger and thirst caused him to have poor health or stamina, often leads to these knowledges to be buried rather than taught. Knowledge does not simply become knowledge because one attain it, but it become knowledge when the idea is spread to the others. So again, it wasn't a necessary one, but if anybody wishes to pursue it, then it is a test of vigilance that many can respect. At the end of day, it comes to one's own mind and sincerity to pursue knowledge, and poverty is just a test or process to proved whether that intention is true or not.","",""
