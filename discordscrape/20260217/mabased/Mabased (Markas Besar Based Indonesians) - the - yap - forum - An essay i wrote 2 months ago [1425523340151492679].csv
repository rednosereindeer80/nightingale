The Sexualisation of a Society

I Would like to first start this essay with a word from the bible Genisis 1:27 
“So God created man in his own image,
    in the image of God he created him;
    male and female he created them.”

In this age of social media and age of technology there has been a prevalent rise in sexualisation throughout the world as it can be seen almost everywhere now, fashion, movies, actors, our daily content/media and even in dating. This progress has been seen as liberating and encouraging freedom for women and those who speak against it has been labelled as a backward thinking human. However, I would like to say the opposite as it has caused massive damages to men and women in dating, communications and mental health destroying the mental health of so many men and objectifying women to become a product instead of a real person. This type of content sexualisation has been propagated and marketed carefully by the corporate and business industry to sell more of their product to fuel their competition and their everlasting attempt to dominate the market yet forgetting the ethics of it.","",""

The biggest fault lies in social media such as Instagram and TikTok for promoting this content and encouraging it as a creator in Instagram or TikTok has only one job which is to garner engagement. Knowing this fact a lot of creators like to add promiscuous things into their content without it going over the terms and condition and policies of these social media platforms. Because of that creators who add more promiscuous content have more engagement which leads to more viewers eventually effecting children who happen look at this content. The Fashion Industry propagated this to sell more of their products to women and men by selling them based on their insecurities.","",""

The dangers of this is desensitization and marriage, in which one of these is increasing and the other it decreasing. What people don’t realise what happens in a society that promotes scandalous behaviour and wear is the increase of a generation with less connection. When it comes to gen z it has been proven statistically that they are having less sexual relations and even less in dating how can this happen? In a society that promotes sexual promiscuity we forget the part of looking at the other person of their emotions and commitment. When we remove the responsibility of a sexual relationship we remove and important part of it which is the connection it forms. This can be seen when it comes to birth control although important when it comes to health especially STDs, this removes the responsibility of the relationship between man and women which is a birth, a responsibility very important considering the price of it which is union with another body.","",""

When it comes to research on how this damages marriage this has been proven in many ways. People with more sexual partners in their lifetime are more likely to divorce a study made by a researcher of Pennsylvania State University and University of Utah. Not only that it is proven that living together with your partner before a marriage is more likely to increase a divorce by 33% a research that been done thoroughly by many institutions including the US Army, IFS(Institute of Family Studies). 

In conclusion we have seen less marriage, less relationship, less sexual relations and even objectifying women for marketing purposes. What can we do about it? We have to start going back and rallying instituting more censorship on these types of content to protect not only children, but also the morals of a society and its intergrity/Dignity.","",""
