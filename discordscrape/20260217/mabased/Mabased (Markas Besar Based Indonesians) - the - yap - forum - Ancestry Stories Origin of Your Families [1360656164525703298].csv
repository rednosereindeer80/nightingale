From my mother's side of families, my grandmother gave birth to 13 children, including my grandma being the youngest of the big family. My grandmother, whom I call as ""Coco"" as a nickname, originally came from southern provinces of China, specifically Guangdong Province (She is Hokkien). She learnt Bahasa Indonesia from scratch, married with my grandfather whom taught her Bahasa Indonesia (as he's already living in Indonesia to begin with) while settling in Medan. She managed to become wealthy, that she can afford giving off her wealth to the 13 children of her after death (she died when I was in Junior High) at her age being 100 years old. 13 of her children, including my grandma, each bore about 4 to 5 children each. My grandma specifically, have 4 children, including 2 of my uncles (oldest and youngest), my aunt (second child) and my mother (third child). My mom's family came from a common lineage of Huang. 

From my dad's side of families, my grandmother of father's side gave birth to 8 children, including my grandpa whom I call as ""Kong Kong"" in our family. Unlike my mother's side of families, my father's side of families had been living in Indonesia for generations, mainly in Solo. Many memories told by my father and his older families about how each clans and families can just gather around, then play in the neighborhoods since Solo isn't as big as what we see back in the day. Decades later, each of the 8 children of my father's grandparents now have 2 to 3 children each, with my grandpa have about 3 children of his own, and  my father was the middle child of the family. My dad's family came from a lineage of Yap, in which we are related to the Zhou Dynasty of China from various old stories.","",""
