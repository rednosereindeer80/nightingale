And thats saddening because in a country like Indonesia with rich cultural diversity and history it should be so endorsed
Anthropology pushes forward a historical and a materialist analysis on how civillizations are the way they are, based on material conditions.
Let's take for example the topic of populations, using two of the most apparent and longest form of living humanity has ever used:
Immideate return hunter gatherers and Agricultural

Nomadic immediate return hunting and gathering supports a population of about 0.1 people per square kilometer.  And so they reproduce slowly to stay in that range.  They tend to breastfeed their kids to some extent until they’re 3.5 or 4, and the hormones produced by breastfeeding are a natural form of contraception on top of whatever other methods that they might use so they usually only one kid every 4 years or so, or more.

More intensive sedentary foraging economies like the Pacific Northwest Coast Indians, can support populations of about 1 person per square kilometer.  But rice agriculture can support as many 1000 people per square kilometer.  And rice farmers reproduce accordingly.    it’s no coincidence that the two most populated civilizations in the world, India and China, have their roots in rice farming.

Individual farmers are more productive and successful if they have more kids to do more farm labour for them.  And farmer women stop breastfeeding by 1 year old because of the availability of milk from domesticated herd animals, so they crank out babies sometimes almost every year.  And this makes them more land hungry, and more powerful.  So they easily take over hunter gatherer land.  

And the more land they take over, the more existing hunter gatherers get squeezed into smaller territories and then they eventually get forced to do agriculture as there isn’t enough land to support foraging anymore.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1368124068523540522/1368125329411014656/image.png?ex=69961141&is=6994bfc1&hm=683fbaf3eef3c1180c56e314b981872b7bc02c7148d952487790406011bc4162&",""

This is just me softly saying Materialism is correct and Idealism & Metaphysics is absolute utter garbage.
Materialism, using things within the tangible world, to analyze, or understand, or look at the tangible world. For example, to use material conditions to analyze something, to look at someone sneezing and say that its caused by a virus, not by divine intervention

Another example using history:
Working on the assumption that people don’t just organize into hunter gatherer bands, or kingdoms, or republics because they have **particular values**, or because some particularly** clever perso**n decided to become a king or to invent democracy or because people did a bunch of ayahuasca and thought it would be trippy to do social experiments.  

Instead, working on the assumption that people organize into these different configurations because there are** material and practical conditions that push us into making certain choices and into accepting compromises.**  And we’re also assuming that the values that that people have – that we have – **are shaped by the same material circumstances that shape our social structures and our political institutions.  **

And we’re not just making these assumptions based on some gut feeling or ideology, we’re making these assumptions because we see it play out over and over in the anthropological record in so many ways, as we’ll see as we go along.","",""

Claude levi strauss did that on his mythologiques. Since myths is how our ancestors make sense of phenomena, he interpreted myriads myths as binary oppositions of symbols.

He concluded that the underlying universal logic human use to understand the world is binary oppositions.","",""
