For web development, I think you can divide your project into chunks:
- Divide per module,
- Some module (esp the main functions) might be huge, so divide them again into features,
- Focus on Building, as long as it runs, and no error during compile. You can Test and Fix stuffs later when everything has been fully made.
- Use Sprint; divide into weekly Targets based on Modules/Features/Test case you need. 

Of course use AI to help. If you are freebies use more than one AI. Better if you can find AI that can run in IDE. Else just use Chat","",""
