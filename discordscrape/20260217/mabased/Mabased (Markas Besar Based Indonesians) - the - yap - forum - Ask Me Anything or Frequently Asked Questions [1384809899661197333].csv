But if we don't have much time and spare attention, just play Suikoden II is okay, MC and place is different, it is okay to come back play later, Suikoden I if is it hooked first, like Najwa Shihab says just find one book that you like then you will like to read ...
It is from Shi Hui Zuan or water margin novel loose interpretasi, and from captain tsubasa and saint saiya inspirasi from manga with many character, it is the true combine hero simulation,why it name tepi air, karena setiap perlawanan markasnya selalu di dekat air, entah mengapa...

It focuses more on how an individual moves through history like a part of a history of a bigger group of people that interconnects with each other, a person's relationship with their people, their ideology, their race, their tribe, their nation, their history.

 it is true Code Geass use Geass eye of the king to do their bid, forcefully, but if you think futher, if you are the leader, you must be can make an order to do your bid, without magic power, and the lies, murder, cripple,the mecha,the knight of the rounds, avalon and merlin story, the tradition,Todo,kyoto faction, Kaguya,the media, diethard reid, massacre, hide, erase history,love manipulation, feminism, nuclear power, chess battle,leader,the king,||are must move first, so the followers will moving too,and lesson about what makes a state/country is his people not land, law, organization order, or anything else||, || Suzaku killed genbu, so japanese surrender without fight||, promised to his demon, love to his sisters,racism, eleven jin, numbered lower than Brittania people, knight, aristokrat,being kicked around and laughing stock (like suzaku knighthood)

 China, Europa faction thats is weak Because unity,not competitive drive, Indonesia mention in china faction thats is old,eunuch, etc ||there is tree of thoughts in gate of heaven, like mugen Tsukuyomi,about pain and erase it, with free will gone erased with it?||,

I've already said this multiple of times but belum tentu satu pemerintah dan pemerintahan will FOLLOW what Ganjar and Anies wants to do. I'll explain down below:

1. Ganjar is PDIP and PDIP has a habit of turning the state into a quasi one party state (see Jokowi periode pertama) which means that the opposition will be quite strong and the rhetoric will be how Ganjar is just a puppet for another Megawati dictatorship mastermind control. Citizens who are dissatisfied and players who don't like to see them rule will work in tandem (not cooperate mind you but in tandem) to make sure its not going to be easy. 

2. Anies is a political outlier and a lot of the elites hate him. What I predict will happen if Anies becomes president is two things: 1. either the government will not be effective because Anies lacks the political muscle, meaning nobody wants to be told around by Anies, or 2. Anies will have to pull a Jokowi, forcibly putting his closest people (who aren't necessarily qualified but trustworthy to Anies) into positions of power whom he can trust will secure his regime and have his back, but at the cost of obrak abrik institusi kita.

People seem to think that there will be no problem if we vote Anies or Ganjar. I'd disagree, each presidency we pick different policies and programs and missions and vision, but we also pick problems. Electing Prabowo has the issue of allowing Jokowi to remain supreme and making room for oligarchic control. Tapi permasalah nya ga banyak yang suka ama PDIP and no one will listen to Anies. 

When you pick a president, negara gak automatically will follow what that President wants to do btw (look at Habibie and Gusdur)","","🔥 (5),true (4),BrightShield (2)"

Iraq might also not attacking Iran out of the fact that theyre a US ally in the region. 

Israeli Right wing circles regarding Security of the state also might not fly at all considering Hezbollah, Amal Movement, and Axis of Resistance will not existing. 



Siege of Mecca might never happened, War on Afghanistan and supplying the jihadist might becoming easier and the US wouldn't have to rely on Pakistani networks

to answer @Jax question, I felt like posting it on Discord is more appropriate than posting it in Instagram to the wider audience.

I don’t know if you’re expecting a response from anyone about this, but this feels like something I needed to say. 

And I hope it helps you, and anyone else, including me, feel a little more at ease, even if it’s just for a while (because we deserve that, for fck sake).

Thank you for being honest and open about this. I can imagine this isn’t something easy for you to do.

So please, take your time with it. You don’t have to perform or show up in certain ways all the time, especially when your whole being is asking you to be here and now with yourself.

So yeah, again, take your time.
When it’s ourselves at stake, everything else deserves to be put on the waitlist. It’s hard to do, but not impossible.
