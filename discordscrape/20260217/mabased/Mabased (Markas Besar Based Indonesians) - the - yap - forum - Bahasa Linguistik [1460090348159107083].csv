I have met a Minangkabau blue bird driver calling himself Malay, but that is not my argument for today. The sociopolitics are in the end, not the same in Indonesia and in Malaysia.

But personally, I dislike that exact definition of the word given to us, as if that narrative appears to dismiss the diverse and distinct ethnicities and identities across the archipelago, when the general perception thought of a Malay person, you'd imagine a person of the Islamic religion and customs residing in Malaysia. Therefore if the word “Malay” would be the umbrella term, it would glosses over the past that there are unique and different identities across the region, ruining peoples' (especially foreigners) perception of the numerous identities in the region.

Of course, the main thing we have in common is that we used the Malay language as a trading language spoken in the coasts, as would the Javanese called it, Bahasa Ayam, the chicken language vernaculars. Using the logic that who used it is automatically Malay would mean that:
- The Balinese, a group of people thought to be special for keeping their ancestral Hindu-Buddhist beliefs among Muslims and Christians in the region, are Malays 
- The Javanese, the majority Muslim people who've still kept their Hindu-Buddhist as well as their animistic roots and traditions, syncretizing it with their unique interpretation of Islam, are also Malays. (Note that Javanese populations are likely to be more diverse regarding religious identity)
- The  Makassarese, seafaring traders, diaspora builders, political networks across the archipelago, with their own scripts (Lontara), adat law, cosmology, and identity, too should be considered Malay using that logic;
- And even somehow, the Papuan ethnics, the Melanesian people almost fully distinct from the rest of people in the archipelago, but suddenly Malay due to the use of Malay language for trades.","",""

You may despise that term, but the inconsistency hits Indonesian harder, as Indonesia is directly translated as the Indian islands. Hence, many are arguing on the term Nusantara to be resurrected, despite it’s Javanese origins. I think you are arguing on behalf of the Minangkabaus who still are very close neighbours and influence the Malay ethnic groups near them. But that is if we play or prefer with Indonesia as the political lens of choice here. It is not my job to say the Malays are a race of people, people can be whatever they want. I was arguing on the language branding of Minangkabau. 

On the umbrella term, you chose Austronesian, a more scientific name, not a colonial name but a third party name. The Malay archipelago was coined by the French, calling it Melayunesia or shortformed Malaysia. Shout out to bro @Melayunesian [2020-2025]🪦 

The French to the Malays are not a colonial party which water down that stench for me. Though the French colonised Indochina. Now, the Malays are fragmanted with inconsistent definition, but the Malay language persists. If the Minangkabau calls it a language, fine. No issue. But know that there are dialects of Malay that is incomprehensible to another Malay native speaker. If @Juanster were to speak in his Sarawakian dialect, I will not undertsand it. 

If we talk about preference in naming a language to unite the race, that’s the issue. English is English no matter who speaks it. If the Malays are reduced in it’s political identity, fine, but the language should be returned to its original name.","",""
