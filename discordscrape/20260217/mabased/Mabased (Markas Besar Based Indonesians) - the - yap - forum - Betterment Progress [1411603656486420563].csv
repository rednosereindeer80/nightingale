To start with, I want to apologize for everything I said that had gone too far in a few of my freaky jokes. I did reflect on it deeply after Darren gave me X1 and 1 day timeout. I feel ashamed and want to create a better change for myself. I realized as much I apologized multiple times to some of you, I kept getting back to being freaky, which can be funny, but at the cost of forming another pattern where the joke straight up went too far or not even a joke anymore, but downright horrible. From these patterns that happened a few times, especially with the last one, I've decided to make this forum for myself (and a few people if they want to join). The source of my problem was the fact that I went too far with being freaky, so I need to disciplined myself by making an event called Puasa Freaky. Everyday I will post a post inside this forum of Puasa Freaky, counting my days (of not being freaky) then wrote anything in order to reflect myself while abstaining from doing or saying anything about being freaky (in this discord server). 

In order to not repeat the last mistake, I realized I need to stop my addiction from being freaky by detoxing it. At least this need to become a habit of mine for 2 months in order for me to be able to behaved much better naturally without resorting to freakiness. For those of you who want to join of not being freaky, you are free to join in order to make it through together. I also prefer if people sees me acting freaky or about to be freaky in the server to reply: ""Jax No Freaky"" like ""Swiper No Swiping."" It will actually be a good starter for me to start getting reminded to behave then act properly. I want to change for the better and stay as part of the server: so this is what I do in order to be better. 

Thank you, and I apologize once more. I will try to learn not to be freaky and slowly matured up in my acts. 

Anyway, this is my first day doing Puasa Freaky.","",""

The work yesterday managed to make me focused on the task for whole day, while the server last night got wee too freaky. Yet nevertheless, I managed to avoid it then focusing on not being freaky from the starred messages.

Finally day number 5. I managed to pass it due to how tired I am with works so it was and still the best option to distract myself. Today is basically my resting day, as I have no students in my schedule to teach. By Saturday I should have reached a week of not being freaky at all. Slowly but surely, I started to get used to it: and it is a positive note to make it a permanent habit in the near future.","","👍 (1)"

Managed to reach a week milestone of doing no freaky. Now I just need to reach 2 weeks and it will be gucci to continue it until a month.
