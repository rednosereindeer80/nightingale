Unlike earth, the consequences didnt bring anything bad to the proletariat, instead good stuffs. Empires like the Stivvish Empire, Savolian Empire, Ardeynian Empire, and otber nations prioritised industrialisation so much, that they made the proletariat too comfortable, by paying them more farmers. Crop productions were prioritised on urban workers rather than rural farmrrs, and even worse, rural farmers were underpaid due to higher industrial efforts by hovernments that led to the bigger wages of the factory workers.

Capitalism took a role in this lore. It profits off from the factories, but atleast due to government efforts, they are more paid and had more comfort than rural farmers. The system allowed land ownership, but unlike factories, the lands were just owned and the peasants were paid lower than industrial workers, and they had worse working qualities. Lower subsidisation efforts, shortages for peasants, and of course as i said before, lesser pay.

Here, we have a famous critique, called as Omnel Bosravat!

Omnel Bosravat was born in 1698 in the Novalian, he was born in a middle high class, a son of a rich peasant that owned some lands in his country. He grew up to have a good quality of education. Since he was young, he became an anti feudalist and capitalist.","",""

The industrial revolution hit in 1740 in Eusolarth, and as you remembered, it brought some good stuffs and bad stuffs. He advocated for a peasabt revolution, overthrowing landlords, business owners, capitalism, and feudalism. Contrary to Earth's Marxism, HE IS AGAINST THE PROLETARIAT, DEEMING THEM AS THE PEOPLE WITH TOO MUCH COMFORT!! Other than capitalists and feudalists, he blamed the proletariat for the class inequality.","",""

He said that it's neccessary to make a centralised government, because this system should be protected and should be sustained by the government, a communal society must be formed tightly because it cant sustain itself, it will fall. On collectivism stuffs, he thought that peasants could volunteer on it, but under a centralised Bosravatist state, you should not bring business at all, because it is a capitalistic element.

On tradition, he mildly promotes it. But he also called for the abolishment of capitalist/feudalistic tradition, so it makes sense. He is no against religion.

His thoughts on intrrnationalism is.... neutral. He doesnt care about it, but doesnt speak out against it. He doesnt advocate for it, because he thought that one state is enough. This idea is hard to be realised in a country, let alone the world. 

But.... this ideology has been realised in Eusolarthian countries, well... most of the countries betrayed the original idea and reformed it to be even more pro proletariat due to the worsening situation for the prolets. But the first practice of Bosravatism was in.... Novalia itself, Novalian revolutionary by the surname of Khosevich formed the Socialidt Federative Republic of Novalia, succeeding the Novalian Empire after tbe civil war on post Eusolsrth WW2 era that lasted from 1897 to 1904, and the republic was formed in 1905. 


In conclusion, Bosravatism is an anti capitalist and anti feudalistic, anti proletariat, anti industrial, anti tech, kinda pro tradition, kinda neutral on internationalism, pro peasant, communist, authoritarian, kinda pro religion, and probablyn thats it.

Feel fee to... correct? Probably there would be something...... unlogical. Im an amateur writer anyways.","",""
