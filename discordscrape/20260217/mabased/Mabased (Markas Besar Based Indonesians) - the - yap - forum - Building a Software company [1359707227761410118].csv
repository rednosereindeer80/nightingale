Software thing is an advance solution that require program etc. and u'd better focus on simple thing first while building experience and connection. (since u arent experienced on code and lack of budget).

Business Idea is a good thing. Try and error is normal thing. But u'd better ready for the critical situation by proper plan.

The point is, 'start simple, software isnt ur start line. Try developing a small business by offline or whatsapp, and make it perfect time by time. Learn from mistake, make SOP or Procedure, qualification, related law, and connection to costumer and affiliation. Once everything prepared, then u ready to turn your business into a software.'
