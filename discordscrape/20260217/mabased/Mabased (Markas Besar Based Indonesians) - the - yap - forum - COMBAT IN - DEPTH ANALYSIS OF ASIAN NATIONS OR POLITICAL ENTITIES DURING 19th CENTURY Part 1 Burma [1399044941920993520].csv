    During early 1800’s, the Konbaung Dynasty had put a much more forward and expansionist strategy to claim the western theatre as part of their plan originally to create a westward empire. The plan was mainly caused by the geopolitical conditions, faced with Qing China to the north and Siam to the east, leaving the western borders being the only available choice for Burma to expand. By 1822, the dynasty invasion into Manipur and Assam put pressure to an enemy they would soon regret: the British. The British previously had severed ties with the Burmese since 1811 due to how the Burmese played both sides between the French and the British, further enraged when the French were allowed to dock into the Burmese harbours. Eventually, the first casus belli for the First Anglo-Burmese War happened in 1824, when the Burmese sent troops to further occupy the territories near Chittagong, only to clash with the local British sepoys over a misunderstanding in Shalpuri Island. The occupation along with the clash caused war between the British and the Burmese forces, which ended up with the British victory in 1826. In 1852, another war broke out between the British and Konbaung Dynasty which initiated Second Anglo-Burmese, which only lasted than less of a year by 1853. Weakened and humiliated by these losses, the Burmese monarch attempted to create further reforms on his government, including the military, yet the results were mixed to say the least. By 1885, the Third Anglo-Burmese War sealed the dynasty’s fate as the whole realm was defeated in an almost bloodless war with little resistance was given against the British army.","","👍 (1)"

    Suffice to say, the Burmese army during 19th century mainly relied on feudal system to gather their troops to fill the ranks. As a result, the organization of the army itself can be described to be loose with only certain professionalism exist for the veterans or royal elite forces. Corruptions were pretty rampant with the self-regulated and funded armies that were gathered by local heads or nobles that were called upon war, lowering morale and the possibility of armies being well equipped. Another golden opportunity for corruption in the army also happened with men that have sufficient wealth supposedly can bribe local officials to exempt them from military services, citing illness or death as the main cause of their absence. Both civil and military positions were run by the same people, as even judges or local officials were expected to have capacities to command an army. Obligatory services were imposed to all Burmese populace, supposedly to men aged from 17 to 60 years old. Yet in a few records, they levied old men and young boys into the ranks too. Meanwhile for the only standing professional army such as the royal army, which includes infantry, cavalry, elephants and artillery. Yet the hereditary and feudal nature of the standing army is still there, with every time a member of the royal army died, his heirs will continue the service as they were regarded to be official servicemen to the dynasty. The privileged status of the standing army however, was deemed generally unpopular as it was common for a few to avoid military duties. British observers had even concluded that the overall quality of the Burmese standing army was very low, as at its worst, the whole army was incompetent, while at best, only the officers were inexperienced.","",""

Discipline of the armies were dependent on how competent the military heads that command them, though the idea of military punishments did exist to enforce organization. In several records, the punishment can go as far to punish the whole families of each military member that broke certain rules, resulting in a mass execution by some reports. Attempts to reorganize the military were done through the Burmese recruitment on foreign advisors. Native sepoys or runaway Europeans were recruited in order to train the Burmese standing military, with more French and Italian advisors added into the regiments after the defeat of the First Anglo-Burmese War. However, the issues such as underpayment, lack of incentive, to even tensions with the natives caused many foreign advisors to leave Burma, leaving only a few that stayed in Burma. Even so, the result of the drilling from foreign advisors managed to get the Burmese military to at least do a proper military parade and some mock battles during late 19th century.","",""

    During the First Anglo-Burmese War, most of the Burmese were armed with traditional weapons. Bows, spear, javelins, crossbows, and sword dah were used during battles with British observers reported to see sightings of these weapons. Muskets were used throughout the first until third wars with the British. Ever since Alaungpaya’s reign, the Burmese were said to “prefer firearms over their spear and sword” by late 18th century. In 1795, it was said that the royal arsenal held about 20,000 muskets that came from various origins. A few are French manufactured or those that came from the British East Indian Company. Yet despite the large numbers of muskets’ stockpile, many of them were unusable or broken firearms, as during the First Anglo-Burmese War, there was a claim that only roughly 5,000 muskets are perfectly suited for service while the rest of 10,000 muskets were unsuited to be used by the Burmese. After the defeat during the first war, King Tharrawaddy suspected that the lack of firearms to be the key factor of the defeat. It resulted in the purchase of more firearms as by 1838, as about 17,000 working muskets were available, though in the poorest quality. The kingdom’s situation kept deteriorating as time went on as a British report from 1854 claimed that there are about 25,000 to 30,000 muskets available for the Burmese to use, but no more than 18,000 men can be equipped with it due to the rest of them being broken. During 1882, out of 25,000 to 30,000 men that were armed with firearms, only 10,000 to 15,000 men have their firearms being at least functional to shoot bullets.","",""

In 1865 to 1871, the Burmese managed to acquire imports of firearms such as Enfield rifles and Snider-Enfield breech-loading rifles. Spearmen are still widely used during the first and second wars against the British, and only by late 19th century where the existence of melee-based troops started to heavily decrease with more firearms that are acquired. Nevertheless, the Burmese spearmen or dah when engaged in melee combats, were considered by the British to be physically strong and competent enough to win over against muskets or bayonets. Artilleries were spotted to be varied in size and calibres, with no uniformity within the arsenal. Artillerymen and gunners were most likely raised locally to tend the cannons during defensive positions in towns or stockades. Malay and Burman prisoners were spotted to maintain the cannon in Rangoon from a report in 1852, operating the city’s guns while chained to prevent escape. The Burmese cannons were identified to be 1 pounder, 9 pounders, 12 pounders, 8 and a half pounders, to as big as 60 pounders.","",""

These guns were covered with woods joined together with strong hoops, like the staves of a cask. A unique description by Yule described that the King of Konbaung in 1885 had about 560 jingalls, 270 brass guns, 200 iron guns and 40 mortars that were stored inside the palace during his visit in Amapura with Arthur Phayre, with only 53 of them were mounted in carriages. As such, many of the artillery pieces that were stored are not suited for service. During the third war, most of the guns that are rounded by the British were described to be mostly antique guns, very old in date with some primitive designs. For most of the campaigns, these guns were not used in open battle but rather defensive siege battles due to the struggle of carrying these guns around, making them mostly usable for towns, cities or walls.","",""

    During the period of resistance against the British, many loyal followers of the monarchy along with some Burmese nobles joined up into the ranks of bandit bands called the Dacoits. It was a term to call a bandit by the British in late 19th century, with the term dacoity means that any act of robbery or violence committed by 5 or more members. Many of the dacoit members were mixed in origins. Though it was true that there are loyalists who joined the ranks to rebel against the British, many of the dacoits were also part-time brigands, professional bandits, with some even goes as far being former disbanded Chinese soldiers or deserters from the province of Yunnan. Alas, there are three distinct actions done by the dacoits: traditional village feuds, banditry, and resistance movements against the British. And despite that the dacoits were well known for their banditry and pillaging, even killing their own people within the villages, several British sources admitted in the late 1880’s, that the dacoits were generally respected by the Burmese. The dacoits’ most infamous activities were during 1885 to 1887 within the Upper Burma, as many rebels had resided within these areas, organizing what’s left of their numbers to stand against the British control of the whole regions. However, as much as they were respected, due to desperate circumstances caused by the lack of men and resources in the later stage of the rebellion, the dacoits started to eventually turn into violence or intimidation within the villages (though many of their violent reports were doubted to be the full truth). For this reason, it caused loss of support within the populace overtime, leaving only the hard-core of the dacoits bands to survive by any means necessary.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1399044941920993520/1399046963432787999/image.png?ex=69967fc5&is=69952e45&hm=955c035b575d3730f729bc082121b5be0f7eb67a8d4196386e4eb868a7cfc15a&",""

    Surprisingly, for groups of dacoits that declared their loyalty to the former monarchy of Konbaung Dynasty, these groups were some of the most organized compared to the other dacoits groups. Their association with the prince or even related events in the palace massacres usually gave the dacoit’s leaders that led their groups a good amount of support from the populace, as they even formed their own court ceremonies. Positions such as ministers, governors, officers, officials, and other so-called royal positions were created under these groups, as they were tasked to strengthen their positions in return for contributing on the resistance against the British. Most notable group was the one that led by Myinzaing Prince, a half-brother to the former King Thibaw of Konbaung Dynasty before the dissolution of the nation under the British. Other Konbaung princes declared themselves to be rulers of their own dacoit groups while controlling different areas in Upper Burma. Usually, dacoit groups consisted of only a few dozen men when enacting their operations, but during partisan war against the British, they can muster about 200 to 600 men according to some British records.","",""

In terms of quality, most of them were not that organized as one British record wrote that out of thousands of its members, only a few hundreds that were considered more professional soldiers. Oftenly, feuds between two dacoit bands can happen when they were in disputes over villages that should give them weapons or men to join them. Villages which refused to give aid to the dacoits found themselves attacked, with loyalties can often shifted between one dacoit band to the other. The terrains and geographies provide the dacoits a chance to do long-term guerilla warfare against the British, though it can only be done through having only a few hundreds of men being deployed for a guerilla campaign, not thousands (a contrast to the previous statement of certain princes of the dacoit groups having thousands of men.)","",""

    During the guerilla warfare between the British and the dacoits, a wave of relentless hit-and-run, ambushes and harassment was done by the Burmese. According to the British reports, the dacoit’s modus operandi includes loot mails or convoys, ambushing smaller British patrols, shoot down officers or men from almost inaccessible places in scarcely penetrable jungle, raid or attack on unprotected and weakly garrisoned posts, to shoot sentries at night, to fire or pillage any villages that were protected or friendly towards the British (even massacring them), occupying any unprotected villages, extorting resources along with manpower (with harsh punishment for refusals), punishing the Burmese who they deemed as traitors with horrible death punishment as a stern example. These activities made the dacoits notorious within their reputation as the British found it hard to repel the attacks of these bandits or rebels. Foot infantry or soldiers often find themselves to be an easy target by the dacoits to shoot far away, while retreating when the situation isn’t within their advantage. Villages which were loyal to the British or protected by the British found themselves being attacked by the dacoits, often times through intimidation with musket fires as they would run away from the village, leaving the resources for the dacoits to rob. However, interestingly enough, when these villages didn’t surrender, they will attack the villages by burning the village then rob the occupants that were escaping with valuables. Understandably, the dacoits usually choose to not attack any villages that were awake or aware of the dacoits’ threats or larger in numbers, which created a custom for each village to have their occupants shot a few musket fires every night to discourage the dacoits from attacking.","","🔥 (2)"

Even when they tried to find the dacoits’ bases, rarely it was something that can be celebrated, as more than often, they would only find empty stockades, deserted villages, and camps evacuated. This series of events often lead to disappointments and lowered morale for the British soldiers, and as if it can’t get any worse, the dacoits often use their advantage in the local terrains to ambush the British at any time when they were weakened then left quickly when the odds are not in their favors. The dacoits only decided that they would make a longer stand in fight through three things: their escape routes are cut off, when their positions are naturally advantageous to make a base out of it, or they were surprised and generally didn’t have enough time to disperse that quickly after firing their volleys. On the later stage of Burmese campaign by 1886 to 1887, the British find out that the best way to quickly defeated the dacoits were not using infantry nor artillery units, but rather: mounted units. Cavalrymen proved to be effective in routing Burmese rebels, as these dacoits found themselves to actually be fearful against cavalrymen due to how quick they can arrive to the scenes (though obviously not on the mountains or dense jungles for obvious reasons).","",""

Their appearances in the field also served as a psychological intimidation since one record even mentioned how a single British lancer from the 1st Bombay Lancers managed to rout 40 to 50 dacoits, and with the help of friendly Burmese: captured a dozen prisoners. The dacoits had the chances to deliver devastating damages to these cavalrymen as these horsemen were supposedly effective to be cut down with a few volleys when they were travelling in smaller squadrons. Yet for some reasons, these rebels didn’t do so as they cower in fear with how these horsemen can and able to locate them easily compared to the infantry. A significant example of how these mounted units were effective was in March 1887, where 50 of the 1st Bombay Lancers managed to attack then destroyed 700 dacoit bands, leaving 200 wounded or killed dacoits, with a few being captured then the rest running away. Many of the dacoits’ groups fought to the death or escaping against the British, but eventually, the British changed their tactics of approaching these dacoits. Multiple times they offered deals with the dacoits to surrender in return for amnesty or buying these men’s loyalties, which in a few events, it did work to undermine then crumbling the dacoits’ resistance against the British. The dacoits’ activities slowly faded away with the death of dacoits’ leaders, with a few being captured or even willingly surrendered to the British.","",""
