    Originally coming from China during 18th century, they had started to migrate and settled in northern Burma and eastern Assam, with different names being called for them according to several sources. The Chinese called them ye-jen (translated as savages or wild men), while the Shan people known them as Kang people. The Kachins however, called themselves as Chingpaws, later corrupted into Singphos or Jingphos (at least by today’s term). During the First Anglo-Burmese War, these people were recruited and deployed along with the Burmese with their first contact with the British in 1825, added with several hostile engagements with the Kachin raiders or rebels following British annexation of Assam in 1843. The Kachins themselves owed nominal allegiance to both Konbaung Dynasty or the Qing China, though the Kachins didn’t really contribute much other to their overlords other than tributes or manpower. The British themselves have little to no contact with the Kachins, with some of them often settled in lands that were not administered by the British, leaving them untouched. It was only after the Third Anglo-Burmese War, the British tried to install a few candidates to rule as the head over the Kachin populace, only to ended up in failure. Maung Kala was the first to be elevated by the British to become the head out of the 3 Kachin chieftains that were in office, only to get assassinated in just two months in office, then followed with other candidates that found themselves unable to stay within a region where the vast majority of their populace were hostile against them. The British even tried to install one popular local figure such as Maung Po Saw (U Po Saw), only to realized that the popularity of his was largely derived from Maung declared his hostility against the British.","",""

Even after the rebellion were suppressed, various other rebellions done by the Kachins continued, with some of the periodic rebellions lasted until 1915.","",""

    The Kachins were never united as a unified force, being divided over feuds and jealousy, furthermore with the sub-groups, tribe, dialects, and clans. There were 5 important parent tribes that can be considered out of these groups: Lahtawng, Lepai, Maran, Marip and N’hkum. Out of these 5 parent tribes, the Lepai and some of the Lahtawng people were known to be the fiercest in giving a resistance against the British. There are other groups that the British added as part of the Kachin people, which includes Atsi, Daru, Lisu, Lashi, Maru, Nung, etc (though later on it was revealed that not all Kachins that were grouped together were Kachins to begin with, as its culture differ from the other). Geographically, the Kachins were divided by the northern and southern Kachins. The northerners, being referred to as Khakhus, while the southerners referred to as Chingpaws. Politically, the Kachin people were divided into Kamsas and Kumlaos. The Kamsas were the ones that each have hereditary chiefs that lead them, referred by both Burmese and British as sawbwas. Meanwhile the Kumlaos were those that didn’t have any leaders to begin with, as they were observed to be mixed communities that have either councils of elders or elected headman amongst them. Within the Kachin villages, the ability to govern a territory as a chieftain were surprisingly more democratic with the leader had to consult with his elder council. Even more surprising, it was believed that the real authority didn’t came from the chieftain, but more than often: his own council that approve, advise and bringing in the proposal. Thus, the real authority of each Kachin chieftain depended entirely on how he made an acceptable policy or proposal while convincing the council about it.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1404873302136193157/1404873546727034880/image.png?ex=69969a32&is=699548b2&hm=832aa6a8afbf710204357b4d55f8deafbf6693280923659aeb74d6ba83b43e6f&",""

    The Kachins’ traditional weapons include the dah sword, spear, matchlock musket and crossbow. All Kachin men were armed with dah sword, supplemented by a spear or a crossbow, with less chances for a musket. The dah swords that these Kachins possessed were to be said effective enough to even cut large iron nails without being marked. Their crossbow bolts were smeared with poisons, though how widespread the adoption of this method was unknown in the Kachin communities. One account even stated how the Kachin besiegers can smeared their bolts with coils of sulfur to cause fire. Though the Kachins possessed firearms, reports stated that these weapons were not used extensively, as the usage of firearms were not widespread within the communities. Traditional Kachin firearms were home-made Chinese-style matchlocks, which are lighter, long-barreled and possessed smaller bore to shoot projectiles with no buttstock. Instead of filling the bore with one bullet, it is said that these Kachins filled their firearms with two or three bullets, even included slugs at a time. Though not accurate, British reports regarded their weapons to be “carry far and hit hard,” though the Kachins deemed them to be useless as they only used them mainly to scared off foes.","",""

Some of these guns were obtained from Yunnan, as a few converted Enfield or Winchester carbines were carried by the Kachins. Regardless, matchlock and flintlock muskets were by far, still the most common firearms that the Kachins used during the late 19th century. Percussion muskets are highly prized and rare for the Kachins to carry, with the materials for its bullets imported from China or Shan States. The Kachins had not artilleries at their disposals, though on a few rare cases, some chieftains did possess a few jingalls and swivel-guns, only for their existence to be scarce by 1890’s. The Kachins continued to equipped themselves with firearms and dah swords, including the 1915 Kachin Hills Uprising, where a few hundreds of Kachins engaged in a rebellion against the British.","",""

As a matter of fact, the Kachins were noted for their bravery in battles during their fights against the British. Their reputation had been famous within the Burmese mainland, that the Shan people hate and fear them, while the Burmese sees them in great awe according to a few testaments. The Kachins believed to have enjoyed “a good fight” which left them win frequent fights against the Shans, while the British did recruit a few Kachin men under their ranks. Blood-feuds are considered important to the Kachins, as they even deemed it more than a right: but a religious duty. Raids on villages were done in the old fashioned South East Asian warfare, with unsuspecting ambushes committed by them at night, or leaving their foes until a favorable condition comes in if the victims proved to be much more resistant and capable in fights. Slave raids were also conducted out of the need for labors in their agricultural farms, as the Kachins still practiced slavery to fill enough labors that can farm their crops. Victims of their attacks includes Burmese or Shan villages, with some villages even bribed the Kachins to not attack them by paying certain tributes (though tributes were also sent to negotiate releases of their own kinsmen). However, their attacks on the British were mainly defensive rather than offensive according to the British reports.","",""

They usually sniped the British soldiers through cover of terrains that the jungles offered, or through stockades where they gained the defensive advantage before withdrew when the odds weren’t in their favor though held their grounds with great determination. The Kachins are considered quick in erecting defenses while putting blockades against the British in order to prevent the enemies to come through the path such as felled trees, before firing their projectiles against them as they were halted by these obstructs through their stockades. Another defensive measure to block the path was to cut away part of the path itself, especially on the very narrow paths within the hills. This caused the British to not being able to transport their goods or let their mounted units passed through. The stockades that were built by these Kachins were dangerous affairs for the British, with the Kachins designed their defenses with spikes and sharpened points. Other stockades provided some earthworks with large hollow bamboos that allowed for the Kachin defenders to find loopholes, then shoot their projectiles through the open holes. The most sophisticated of these stockades includes Chinese guidance in building these defenses, as one account in 1893 described that they have a Chinese commander along with some Chinese that helped constructing defenses in Chinese style fortifications.","",""

Due to the constant defensive measures and the rare occasion of these people fighting in open battles against the British, some British sources deemed them as cowards. Though it was unlikely due to cowardice, as Afghan sepoys serving under the British gave them great respect for standing their grounds and fight against the fierce sepoys. They even nicknamed these Kachins as “the Afghans or Parthans of Burma,” acknowledging them as equals to their prowess. It was suspected that the main reasons behind their lack of unification or even proper strategies against the British was due to the lack of quality leadership from the chieftains, with no charismatic figures ever lead these Kachins to a proper objective other than a few exceptions.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1404873302136193157/1404874108721696868/image.png?ex=69969ab8&is=69954938&hm=539b8ecd459d460c98a1138f77650c881ef04db04ae9842f5b3256b396b13ec3&",""
