    The Karens are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Burma, making up roughly 750,000 people by the end of the 19th century. There are many clans or tribes that exist within the group, with the same language but different dialects that none of them could understand each other. Politically, the British divided the Karens into two groups: the White Karens & Red Karens, named after their principal colors of attires or clothing respectively. The White Karens can be found almost entirely in Lower Burma, while the Red Karens resides within the hill tracts of Upper Burma, also known as the Hill Karens. The White Karens got the most exposure with the Burmese along with the British as most of them would come under the British administration in 1853 as Lower Burma was annexed. These White Karens were noted to already waged a few wars against the Burmese, with constant inter-tribal or village warfare between themselves, and later on against the British during annexation. Some of them recruited by the British, even fought for them within the second and third war against Burma. A battalion of Karen police were raised in 1891, only to be disbanded later on by 1899 due to how ineffective they are which by the report itself: an unfortunate affair in which liquor played a prominent part. The Red Karens on the other hand, was reported by the British to be “the most warlike and courageous races of all Burma.” They were the ones that effectively preserve their independence way longer than the White Karens, having historically fought against the Chinese and Shan for it while forming Karenni State (basically princely states consisted of petty rulers), a territory located at the eastern parts of modern Myanmar. The Red Karens history from 1820’s to 1840’s are filled with dynastic turmoil, with rival factions fought against one another for rightful rule over their own groups.","",""

By 1875, the Western Karenni was recognized by both Britain and Burma to be fully independent until by 1888, a mistake from a minor expedition done by Sawlawpaw, a ruler of the Western Karenni caused the British to intervene with his failure to respond against the British demands. By 1889, Sawlawpaw was defeated then escape from his state, never to return again. The continued resistance from the Red Karens happened in 1902 by a thousand of tribesmen that got quickly dispersed. Ever since then, the British never placed proper control nor the Karenni State was under direct control of colony, with the natives pretty much retained their independence in several practices.","",""

    While the White Karens immediately came under British administration and annexation, the Red Karens had Shan-style rulers for their states. All men were expected to serve once called by the sawbwa of each state. Specifically for the Red Karen states or the Karreni State, the sawbwas managed to mustered enough retainers while paying substantial amount for levies for a feudal administration due to them having enough minerals within their own geography. Example of it can be seen from Sawlawpaw as he was guarded with 150 guards in 1880’s (quite a numerous amount for a small state), with the biggest number of retainers ever recorded was about 300 musketeers by other account. Each Karen villages were recorded to be fortified with bamboo stockades and punji sticks, quite the usual defensive structures for the South East Asian standard.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1406260907713233006/1406261063279972534/image.png?ex=6996606c&is=69950eec&hm=ed49616022f87ebd3d1217880386773a6bc7d2a5b1dff732a28b69f0c634a054&",""

    The Karen people were armed with various variants of spears, javelins, crossbows, firearms, knives, and swords. The Karen, preferred shooting from behind the jungles as the British observed them to be expert in this method with their crossbows, while their bolts sometimes were smeared with poisons. The average Karen warrior carried a customary combination of knife, sword, spear and crossbow, combined with one or three javelins. Matchlock muskets were rare by early 1800’s in terms of usage, only by 1850’s where the Chinese matchlocks became used by most Karen warriors. In the later 19th century, these matchlocks slowly replaced with flintlock muskets and modernized Enfield rifles. The Karen people are capable to make their own gunpowder, though needed to import sulfur from the Shan States and Konbaung Dynasty, while buying a few percussion caps from Qing China. They produced their own ammunitions, either in the form of lead bullets or even stones.","",""

    Regardless of White or Red Karens, warfare amongst the Karen people involved ambushes, raids and counter raids for most of the time. Inter-village disputes were considered the most common form of conflicts between the Karens, with blood feuds being common within the communities. The Red Karens, or Kayah specifically, held lives “very cheaply” according to the British reports. They went on to raid villages during blood feuds, in which slaughter and enslavement of the populace became a common occurrence through common South East Asian warfare tactics. British reports suggested that the Kayah slain those who resist when they advance inside the house, while the rest of the party surround the building to cut down any people who tried to escape. Infants and decrepit people were killed, and many children or even adults were massacred, though some were captured as slaves. Yet just like all communities, these attacks were done in a surprise one, which if found out with the local targets prepared themselves, the raid will be abandoned completely without a second thought. Due to these actions, the Kayah people earned themselves the nickname of “kidnappers” or Mannepgha by local tongue. One report from 1837 stated that by each year, about 300 to 400 Shans were annually caught then sold as slaves from the Kayah’s raids. Many Shans or Burmese people became targets for these raiders, with Laotian Shans considered to be the most profitable targets.","",""

Often times they let it be, and even accepted the Kayah’s gifts as a bribe to stopped their efforts. As a matter of fact, the only way to stopped the Kayah attention on them was to simply bought them off, as Kayah people do not make slaves out of people who pay them blackmail. Later on, the Karens were noted to be perfect trackers or scouts used by the British in order to find Burmese dacoits’ bases and paths, where these men noted to taken advantage of the British expedition against the dacoits in 1880’s. No men within the Karen people taken any mounts for mean of transportation, though some heads or chieftains did get noted to take ponies. However, their warfare was still weak against the British as during Sawlawpaw battle against the British from 29th December 1888 to 1st January 1889. The Karens used the paddy fields to gain open field advantage against the British, which obviously became a fatal mistake as the British cannons gain good aim on these open fields to bombard these warriors to pieces. Mounted units even killed about 200 to 300 warriors with their spears and firearms, something that the Karens had no defense against.","",""
