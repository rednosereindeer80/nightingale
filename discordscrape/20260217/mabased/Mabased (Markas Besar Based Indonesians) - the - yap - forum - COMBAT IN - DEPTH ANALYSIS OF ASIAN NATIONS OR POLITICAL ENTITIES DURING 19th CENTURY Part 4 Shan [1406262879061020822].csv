    The Shan people, originally came from the Tai race, which is a race of people who lived within the hills. To be more specific, the northern to eastern hills of Burma, combined with southern and western hills of Yunnan province in China. The Shan people who lived in Burma called themselves the Great Tai people. The Siamese on the other hand, called these people as “Tai left behind” due to their locations while the Burmese finally being the ones that referred them as the Shans. The Shan people migrated to South East Asia from Yunnan by 12th to 13th century, in which they found numerous kingdoms within there, as only Assam and Siam turned out to survive by 19th century throughout the centuries. Eventually, the Shan States was formed in 1527 through the destructions of their kingdoms by Ava, which left the Shan into petty principalities. Traditionally, the Shan States are consisted or known 9 Shan States, which roughly includes Mong Nai, Mong Pai, Yawnghwe, Mong Mit, Mong Leng, Mohnin, Mong Gong, Kale and Samchok (though some also added Moda, Kantigyi, and Wuntho). Other important Shan States that can be included are Bhamo, Kengtung, Hsipaw, and Hsenwi. Although Burma claimed suzerainty over Shan States, the Shan States prefer to offer their allegiance to China as it was only during the 18th century during Alaungpaya reign when the enforcement of this rule is truly done.","",""

Those who declared loyalty to the Burmese, joined in the ranks of the Burmese army during Anglo-Burmese wars, though resented the Burmese due to their incompetence and brutal administration. Eventually, this caused a rebellion to happen in 1845 by Tao Sanghai, a local war hero that inspired rebellion and sustained it until 1850’s. Even after his defeat, by 1882, some Shan States were inspired by Tao’s rebellion to defy the Burmese rule. By the next few years, the rebellion lasted until 1888 when the British settled the matter by splitting the lands between the Shan leaders, ruling as semi-independent states under the British administration. However, some resistance did grow to resist the British after the defeats of Burma, which include one notable case of Maung Aung Myat, sawbwa of Wuntho. His rebellion lasted from 1881 to 1891, which although he managed to escaped, the region of Wuntho was nevertheless integrated into the British colonial provinces. By 1910, a report described Shan States being annexed by the British to be “a condition of social and political confusion, little short utter of chaos.” The Burman interference, exactions, oppressions, and general misrule for three centuries had led the country to the lowest state of calamity that it had ever been known. Robber bands infested the lands, all Shan people did not dare to come out without arms, and thousands of Shan families fled to Chinese Shan States (Yunnan Province) or to lower Burma.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1406262879061020822/1406263011332722739/image.png?ex=6996623d&is=699510bd&hm=93178ec2ac75efcbd0a22d09fadbfb05df43ac4a182847a72836cfd8783953aa&",""

    Each Shan States referred to as Muang in their language, with each Tai varied in sizes, from petty or lesser state, to as big as a province. The biggest state of them all was Hsenwai, which by the mid-19th century, had been disintegrated due to petty rivalries. Like previously stated, each state was ruled by a Shan ruler called saopha, which later called as sawbwa by both the Burmese and the British, with those who are ruling as chieftains or governing smaller territories as tributaries known as little sawbwas. Succession amongst the Shans were pretty unique as although it was hereditary to have the next ruler came from a male line, female lines can still succeed the throne too. The Shan States also have their own courts and ministers, along with advisors whom the Burmese referred as amats, serving the Shan ruler as a council. All able-bodied men are expected to serve militarily when the Shan ruler declared a war and mobilization, with its tributary states under him send their own manpower and supplies too. Practically everyone was called out, with village headmen and provincial officials became officers of the army. There were no standing armies for the Shan States, with only a few Shan rulers kept a few men as retainers by hereditary policies. Their military numbers according to one local sawbwa, can totalled to more than 90,000 men if the whole Shan States gave their men for the Burmese, though most likely this was exaggerated as later on in 1855, it was found out that five Shan States can give a total amount of 14,500 men to the service of the Burmese army. Though their loyalty to the Burmese was often abused, many Shans that fought under the Burmese army were recorded by both Burmese and British accounts to be fighting willingly and bravely. About 8 to 9,000 Shans had been deployed inside the Burmese ranks by First Anglo-Burmese War, fighting various enemies from the Siamese, Karen and the British army.","",""

It was only when Myinzaing Prince who called up for the deposal of his brother, did the Shans answered and mustered up about 81,000 men to his cause with adequate weapons. The main reason why the Shans disliked the Burmese came from the Burmese garrison that exist within each Shan States. These garrisons were controlled by a Burmese official called Bohmu Mintha or Bohmu Min. Meanwhile the soldiers that are garrisoned within the Shan States were described to act “more like brigands than soldiers.” These soldiers acted with indiscipline and arrogance that the Shan locals despise, with its strength claimed by the Burmese to be 10,000 men in the Shan States, though in actuality: it was only 300 to 500 men by 1820’s. Only by 1863 when a rebellion happened that the Burmese increased the garrisons to 5,000 men. As a result, Burmese control over the Shans relied upon manipulation than actual warfare against them in order to divide, weakened and undermine their influence.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1406262879061020822/1406263164131217558/image.png?ex=69966261&is=699510e1&hm=702f8c509b83398bb37f9441c61580158b084f83dbb764becea13c6b3e84601f&",""

    Traditionally, the Shan equipped themselves with dah swords, spears and muskets. Dah swords are considered national treasures by the Shan, that all Shan male members owned one with many variants and size. The Shan can be considered to be one of the most well-equipped people with firearms, as by mid-19th century, half of their units were armed with firearms. Crossbows sometimes were found amongst the Shan units, with arrows smeared with poisons within the minorities of the Shan people. By 1860’s, most firearms that the Shan use are mostly Chinese matchlock style muskets until 1880’s, they have replaced many of it with smoothbore muskets, a few being locally made. A few percussion musket and a handful of breech loaders were found within the Shan communities, considered to be highly prized by locals. During their performance on musketry, the British reports stated that most of the Shan units were more “enthusiastic than accurate” with their shots, as they let out “a shrill jackal-like howl.” It may also because the inaccuracy of their shots that lead to some of the Shan believing that they are bullet-proof which shown during their raids on the modern-day Laos in 1850’s, stating that “no shots were fired” by both Siamese and Shan warriors according to one author: G.J Younghusband as a result from this belief. Rockets were used but in limited usage by the Shan during their deployment in the defense of Kengtung State in 1850’s against the Siamese threat. The Siamese war elephants were reportedly: run away in fear after a few volleys of Chinese rockets were fired by the Shan warriors. Artillery on the other hand, owned by a few sawbwas of the Shan with a few of them believed to have come from Burma for defensive purpose.","",""

    Despite the constant civil wars and some feuds amongst the Shan States, the Shan people were considered to be more affable and not warlike according to many reports. However, once they were roused to fight, they fought fiercely and sometimes with cruelty (several reports had noted that they did slaughter children and women of their enemies, with their dead enemies often mutilated or at least decapitated). Even the British were impressed by the raw courage the Shan warriors shown in battles. During the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1825, at the Battle of Prome in 1st December, the Shan warriors reportedly “fired with steadiness of veteran troops” and their sawbwas “showed a noble example to their men, sword in hand, singly maintaining the unequal contest.” The Shan warriors were also accompanied by three young mounted “prophetess,” dressed in male attire and warlike costume. These three women were considered to be the wives of the sawbwa, yelling exhortations to the Shan soldiers as fighting encouragements. However, the Battle of Prome was considered to be unorthodox tactics employed by the Shan, as due to their hilly origin, many Shan armies relied on raids and surprise attacks. They were particularly adept in ambushes and night attacks, often avoided fights in broad day lights whenever possible. Even when a conflict was widespread, a direct confrontation was shunned by the locals, and for a good reason. It may due to the fact that this tactic had been proven useful, especially for petty Shan States that have limited resources, as they often avoided large casualties by keeping it minimal. During civil wars or petty feuds, the usual tactics committed Shan armies include sudden advance, construction of stockades, desultory firing, starving the enemies out, or to rush to their buildings when the enemies were largely absent due to search for foods.","",""

They build no tents, but instead constructed their own makeshift shelters with branches and leaves, with many forages for foods if their own food provisions run out (though some supplies can be added if their wives sent it). Shan town fortifications were rather looked Chinese style than Burmese style, and very run down. In 1837, the Kengtung fortification was reported to have its bricks and mud walls “so badly erected that it constantly falling down.” Many Shan roads were also very poorly maintained, though a few reports stated by the Shan themselves to be “keeping their paths as secret and difficult as possible.” One notable resistance movement by the Shan came from the formation of Limbin Confederacy or League, a union created by the sawbwas and myosas in Upper Burma to resist against the Burmese rule. They committed attacks on the sawbwas or other Shan States that did not submit to their movements. However, not all joined in due to the requirement of acknowledging Limbin Prince as its suzerain, specifically Saw On, de facto ruler Yawnghwe. He later on submit to the British which in return, gain their aid with the British sent their eight companies along with 40 horsemen, 2 cannons and 50 sappers in 1887. By 19th February, both the British and Shan met at the village of Kugyo, fighting a 15-hours of battle with little to no casualties from both sides (miraculously) as the two forces only exchange desultory fires towards one another.","",""

Only a few key players stayed to fight against the British, which obliged the companies to engage at them with a few put up a valiant fight against them. However, soon enough, all of them either fell in battles, or forced to submit under the British rule. The Limbin Prince himself, later on submitted in June, 1887, before being taken to Calcutta until 1912 (he returned to Rangoon permanently in 1921, staying in a permanent house and given monthly grant). Other resistance continued in the Hsipaw and Hsenwi state throughout 1887, with the British grant other Shan and Kachin soldiers under the British munitions in order to defeat the two states. Another serious but remote fighting occur in 1888, when Twet Nga Lu, who taken refuge in northern Siam, came back with his own forces to defeat the Shan troops, taking Mong Pan town by 4th March, 1888. A quick British column managed to end his rule, capturing him by 10th March, as he died when trying to escape from captivity a few days later. Even though most of Shan States came under the British rule by 1888, Kengtung would later on be submitted as part of the colonial state by 1890, with special administration created for it after negotiations. The only unrest happened in Shan States thereafter was a bunch of dacoit bands causing a few problems for the British, as they remained active in the frontier until 1897.","",""
