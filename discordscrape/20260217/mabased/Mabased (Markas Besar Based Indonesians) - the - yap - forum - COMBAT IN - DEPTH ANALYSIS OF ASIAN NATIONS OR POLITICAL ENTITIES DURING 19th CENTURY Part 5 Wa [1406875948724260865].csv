    The Wa, whom called themselves by various names (from Wu, Vu, Nyo and Pato) inhabiting the parts of northern Siam, northern Laos, and parts of Northern (Shan States) or Northern Chinese Shan States. The Chinese and British, distinguishes these Wa people according to three types: the wild Wa, the head-cutting Wa, and the tame Wa. The Shans sometimes even call some of these Wa people as La if they intermarried with the Shans, or Tai Loi (Hill Shans) if they had converted to Buddhism. There have never been accurate numbers of Wa being counted by the British throughout the 19th century, as they often reserved the name Wa for the wild ones while the Buddhist or intermarried Wa referred by them as Lawa. The three types of Wa people had lived mostly in east of Salween, specifically in the so-called Shan State of Langwun. Many Wa people had been found in Chinese Shan States and Kengtung State too. The Langwun state specifically, had been ruled by a Lawa dynasty (Buddhist ruled Wa), required to pay tributes due to the deal from the past chieftain Tawang with the Hsenwi State (Tawang seized the Langwun state from the past Shan hereditary ruler with the help of Hsenwi in return for annual tribute being given to them). After his death, his nephew: Hkun Sing, stopped paying tribute to the Hsenwi by 1849. And after Hkun Sing’s death, a succession war sparked between Upayaza, Nawpha, and Tonsang. From there on, the Wa States continued to be divided and integrated at the same time between these families. Following the annexation of the Shan States and Upper Burma, the British had minor confrontations with the Wa by 1886 and 1887. However, in 1892, Tonsang submitted under the British in return for their aid to take Nalau, a Wa ruler that had rebelled against Tonsang.","",""

Since then, he mounted a bunch of raids for four years against the Wa States, before withdrew into South Hsenwi, where he died in 1911.
    Although Lawa had been taken under the British, the Wild Wa people however, were never under the British rule until WW2 (basically unadministered) as their territories had only been claimed by both Chinese and British de jure, but never de facto. Located east of Manglun, their areas are pretty much inaccessible with the only serious attempt to pacify them came in 1896 to 1897. Various issues arose between the British and Chinese claim on the Wa States, in which these Wa States claimed to be later on the “no man’s land” with failure to resolve the territorial disputes between the two until by 1936 to 1937, another commission to discuss the dispute ended up with the British getting awarded the whole Wa States. Due to this isolative state of the Wa people, information about the Wa was generally lesser in amount with some information that describes their warfare exist in the later stage of 19th century, with a few existed in 20th century.","",""

    Other than three to four villages mounted a mutual defense under a Wa chieftain, the Wa people generally don’t put up any attempt to unite with each other for an organized state, unlike the Lawa variants. Each villages have their own headmen or chief, but the day-to-day government issues were usually resolved by the councils of elders that generally hold the real power. Should a confederation exist, it was led by a local chief who had above average talent with charisma, receiving tributes and acknowledgement with his great talents in uniting the tribes. Yet this effort was a heavy one considering the Wa people, other than looking out for his neighbors, always tend to see other Wa and foreigners as potential enemies, which resulted in a common way of localized wars against one another. The Lawa states however, generally enjoyed a much more organized state that is comparable to the Shan neighbors.","",""

    The Wild Wa and Lawa generally are able to armed themselves with crossbows, dah swords, spears and Chinese-style matchlocks by 1880’s for their traditional weaponries. Muskets had become a commonplace for the Wa by the early 20th century, as one report stated that two parties of armed Wa people had either carried a musket or a crossbow, sometimes carrying both through observation. The Lawa or tamer Wa however, due to their poorer state compared to the Wild Wa, have more crossbows armed to their men than firearms.","",""

    Warfare between Wild Wa people generally known as head-hunting expeditions. The Wild Wa believed that the acquisition of fresh heads granted them protection from evil spirits while granting the health or fertility of their people, animals, along with crops. Due to this factor, heads were sought after during sowing time, with the raids committed by the Wa began either from February or March, then lasted until the end of April. Sometimes their village reputation was measured by how many skulls that the village obtained, with them being displayed for the public to see, with the largest collection can reach about more than a hundred skulls. However, some efforts to get a few skulls doesn’t require violence, as the Wa do a few trades for skulls or digging graves to get them. The natives also divided the skulls based on their origins, with women and children were preferred considering they was a proof of warrior’s prowess in attacking the heart of enemy territories. Meanwhile, Chinese skulls are highly prized by them considering they were believed to bring good luck for better crops while warding off evil spirits. The Wa put up defenses such as ramparts and ditches surround their village miles away in order to deter raiders from attacking them. This caused the village to only be entered through a long corridor, often times two corridors to enter and exit. Their fortification for stockade was created from huge logs, grown with dense shrubs and thorn bushes that reportedly: not even rifle shots could penetrate it. Even in 1930’s, the British regarded these fortresses to be almost impregnatable as they carried off only rifles without artillery guns (due to the terrains). The only way to defeat the fortress, was through heavily precise shots done by the British soldiers on aiming at the Wa warriors.","",""

In 1880’s, the Chinese fought the La-Hu and its Wa allies in which they managed to repulsed their imperial troops before a larger reinforcement came in during an expedition which lasted for 10 years of fighting. The British often find themselves being sniped by the Wa as they were having “breast-works and rifle-pits at many parts of the roads, and fire vigorously” in 1897. Fortunately, the Wa musketry was regarded to not be accurate in causing extensive damages to the British army though their march had been slow in exploring their paths. In 1887, a Palaung ambush to the British column managed to only kill two mules and wound one driver when delivering their volleys of fire, only to retreat when the British fired off a few rounds of volleys with the warriors dispersed.","",""

The first two figures (Figure 68 and 69) depicted the clothing of Lawa warriors, which had converted or intermarried with the Shan. Although the first figure was actually a Wild Wa who forced to wear a Lawa attire during a trade mission. The next three figures (Figure 70 to Figure 72), are definitely Wild Wa with the third figure was a Wa Pwi. The last figure of the depiction (Figure 73), is a Palaung warrior. The Palaung people often mixed with the Wa people category by the British account though they were different from the Wa, only shared common heritage in languages. Regardless, compared to the Wa, British accounts stated that they were peaceful and timid, suffering from the Kachin neighbors’ raids.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1406875948724260865/1406876220867608609/image.png?ex=6995fa55&is=6994a8d5&hm=b6885a483f1951733442c8171c040e2dd493fa2e53c1806bee854209728b784c&","🔥 (2)"
