Brief History:
    Although being called Cambodia by many, the people of this kingdom kept calling themselves as Khmers during the 19th century. Yet it had lost all of its former glory, with the population in their territories had been reduced to only 600,000 people in 1868 by estimation. The fall of Angkor from 1431 had marked the end of the Khmer Empire by the Siamese, which ended up in centuries of humiliation and disputes between Siam and Dai Viet in claiming Cambodia. Cambodia’s history eventually became a list full of repeated invasions between the Vietnamese and Siamese, each time fighting for Cambodia to be their vassals, with a few anti-Vietnamese and pro-Thai rebellions. Cambodia nevertheless managed to keep its sovereignty although reduced in tributary status, acting as a buffer zone for both sides than an occupied territory. Attempts to played both sides to fight against one another was seized during King Ang Chan during early 1800’s. However, this attempt caused the Siamese to instead aid Ang Sugnon then provided with military assistance to depose his own brother. Ang Chan escape then seek asylum from the Vietnamese, in which they gave Ang Chan sizeable numbers of men to defeat Ang Sugnon, before retaking the throne. As a revenge, the Siamese retreated from the territory but returned a year later to take a few parts of Cambodian’s territories. For the next 3 decades, the Vietnamese have influence in Cambodia, though met with general disdain by the Khmer populace as an anti-Vietnamese rebellion happened in 1820 to 1821. By 1833, with the Vietnamese got thrown into an internal political discord, the Siamese take advantage of it to once more, attacking Cambodia.","",""

As a result, they managed to install Ang Chan for the second time as King of Cambodia. Due to this incident, the Vietnamese placed a much tighter control on the Cambodian, giving a permanent garrison of Vietnamese along with political control on the Cambodian’s court.","",""

A wide range of reforms were introduced in order to “Vietnamising” the whole country to adopt Vietnamese culture and standards with the real power was in the hands of the Vietnamese governor rather than the Queen. But this only fuel the fire of hatred that the Khmer people have against the Vietnamese, causing yet another rebellion in 1840. The Siamese once more take this situation as an advantage to launch another campaign against the Vietnamese, lasting until 1846 in which both sides begrudgingly signed peace deal, recognizing Ang Duong as King of Cambodia while protected by both sides. Because of this event, Ang Duong desperately looking for a powerful ally that can protect Cambodia, and eventually, it found a dangerous one: the French. After the death of Ang Duong in 1860, he was replaced with King Norodom who was approached by the French admiral and envoys. With the French help, Norodom managed to defeat the Vietnamese and even gather Siamese support. Yet this aid came at the cost in 1863 when the French signed a secret agreement to make Cambodia as its protectorate, even forcing Norodom to submit as the French protectorate, effectively ending Cambodia’s sovereignty by another treaty in 1867. Even then, unrest and resistance against the French policies caused the French a good amount of time to properly control Cambodia with its rebellions.","",""

    Due to Cambodian long line of traditions for being an absolute monarchy, there are no standing armies with only a few palace guards that guard their King. Cambodia’s court was mainly influenced by five ministers: prime minister, minister of justice, minister of palace affairs, minister of war, and minister of navy. The administrative of Cambodia was divided into 57 unevenly-sized province by traditions, but it was revealed that there are only 34 provinces, suggested that other provinces had been taken away by the Vietnamese and Siamese. Military service originally called for all males to serve under the King between the age 18 to 50, though a few exceptions exist for hill-tribes, priests, mandarins (Chinese), royal servants, state workers, palace workers and foreign nationals. The mandarins however, needed to send their own clients to be replacements for them, numbering from 20 to a few hundred men. Updates and records about each individuals’ age, names and physical capacity were recorded every three years to avoid any chance to avoid military service. Sadly, due to the small population, in 1854, only 30,000 men were fit for military service. By 1883, only 126,000 people are considered fit to bear arms, thus it was not uncommon to find the Cambodians recruited various Filipino and Malay mercenaries in their battles. The state has to be the one that provided for arms and supplies, which as a result, cause the mustering of manpower to be a troublesome and long process. But fortunately, many armies have little faith on the government to provide them foods, making them bringing their own foods rather than having the government served them supplies.","",""

Efforts to introduce some army reforms had been attempted in 1834 by the Vietnamese Emperor: Emperor Minh-Mang. However, there was no evidence that such reforms had any lasting impact for the Cambodian military. After becoming a French protectorate, the Cambodian military kept a small army that guarded the King, with no more than a few hundred men with an extension of the French military garrison. A few Filipino soldiers were spotted to guard the King by a few dozen men, with later reforms gave the King more soldiers trained by the French standards. This includes infantry, cavalrymen, artillery, bodyguards, etc but with European style. The Cambodian also possessed a small navy, mainly war boats with the ability to defend against musket fires and arrows, yet only operated at best during riverine warfare.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1407406851750101145/1407407159620276354/image.png?ex=6996974f&is=699545cf&hm=795fdacaad7647d325e5af3df16872aaae5d1b3f36544a4b91b3482cf2a9741a&",""

    Similar to the other South East Asian realms, the Cambodian make use of swords, spears, polearms, and crossbows. However, they uniquely possessed one or two-handed swords along with long heavy iron-mounted clubs with hard woods. As a matter of fact, such club weapon called dambang was apparently the most common weapon that the Cambodians use. Firearms were still in infancy as only a few of them exist to be armed by the Cambodian warriors. These firearms, poor in quality, consisted of Chinese-style matchlocks for the early 19th century. By mid-19th century, the Cambodians managed to possessed imports from the French, though even the King’s guards or retainers armed themselves with swords or spears, suggesting the lacking numbers of these western firearms. Their cannons, casted and crafted poorly, small in numbers while carried by wooden carriages. During the campaigns, elephants and carts were used after they dismounted the cannons, at some point even using men on foot to carry it. Ammunitions can be described to be messy, with the home-made gunpowder considered by the records to be poor in quality, with their bullets often did not fit the calibre of their bores.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1407406851750101145/1407407252914311270/image.png?ex=69969765&is=699545e5&hm=93aaaa9950fd56f262f2128d7da370962f4a72eec9a704f8491a6c85c7a8b9f2&",""

    All sources can agree that the Cambodians were not military people to begin with, let alone during 19th century when their power had been diminished from its former glory. Regardless, they still relied on tactics such as ambushes, fortifications, raids and surprise attacks, which were the norms of South East Asian warfare. Their reliance in ambushes by its merits, caused the French a considerable amount of difficulty in fighting against the Khmers. The French, lacked in the geographical knowledge of the terrains, find themselves often being fired by the Khmers, who appeared from the jungles, only to retreat soon enough, causing the soldiers to fired at an empty jungle. However, should the battle turn into a conventional mean, the Khmer armies will split themselves into 5 divisions: the advance guard, the rearguard, right wing, left wing, and the center. The center is where the officer customarily being positioned, surrounded by his corps of war elephants. The Khmers still similarly make a heavy usage of their war elephants for battles, posing the psychological advantage towards their enemies regardless of how impractical they can be. Although the Cambodians record their war elephants to be a force that charged against the enemies bravely, even plunging themselves to crash stockades, ignoring the horror of battles, later sources claimed otherwise. These war elephants understood the dangers that posed in battles, and would more than often, avoid things that can cause harm, leaving the battlefield. It further confirms that the sight of these elephants mainly used to scared off foes, especially the lower morale men who saw dozens of elephants coming right at them. It was considered enough to rout and caused a widespread panic","",""

When King Ang Duong’s death was announced, he attempted to take power from Norodom, which failed in 1861 if not for the support of both Sisowath and the French. Under the French control, Cambodia became the French protectorate under the belief that it will end any interference on Cambodia, creating a profitable vassal with order. However, this soon proven to be false with the peasant uprising in 1866, led by Pu Kumbo who declared that he was the grandson of King Ang Chan, gaining with widespread support from the commoners and some hill-tribes. They managed to go as far as to defeat the Cambodian royal army, which lasted until 1867 when the French army arrived to immediately defeated the rebels with great firepower. Using the momentum of the shaking authority of King Norodom, Si Votha once more declared a rebellion in 1876, returning to Cambodia after his departure from Bangkok. There he raised another band of supporters along with some hill-tribes, besieging Kampong Thom while harassing officials who were loyal to King Norodom. He attacked various areas, with the Cambodian forces failed to stopped his army until 1877, when Si Votha once again, retreated to the sanctuary of the hill-tribes before going back to Siam.","",""
