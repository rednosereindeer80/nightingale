    The name Lao was originally used by the Siamese to describe the Shan States that lived in the strip of territories between Vietnamese and Siamese borders. However, by 19th century, the westerners describe the name Lao to refer them as Siamese Shan States. The Lao states were basically the result of former disintegrated kingdoms such as Lan Xang & Lan Na. Lan Xang by 1707 was divided by succession disputes, making the once united realm turned into four rival kingdoms: Champasak, Luang Prabang, Vientiane, and Xieng Khouang. Meanwhile for Lan Na, subjected to the old princely struggle since 16th century, caused the Shan States to broke free from the realm before subjugated by the Burmese under its rule. Various uprisings were done by the Lan Na nobilities and rulers to find every opportunity to rebel, until finally by 1770’s the Lan Na rebelled under the support of the Siam with a success, making Lan Na an official vassal for Siam. Theoretically, the whole Lao states are tributaries or vassals to the Siamese by the late 18th century, yet by practice, they also paid tributes to other kingdoms. A few kingdoms still gave tributes to the Vietnamese, with others to China. The Burmese, attempted multiple times to claimed the states within former Lan Na as theirs, which resulted in the continuous disputes between Konbaung and Ayutthaya (later turned into Rattanakosin Kingdom).","","👍 (1)"

It was founded by Setthathirath II, an exile prince in Nguyen Dynasty (Vietnam) after his father escaped from a succession dispute in Lan Xang from early 17th century. Suliyavongsa, his uncle, ruled Lan Xang at its golden age for decades before his death in 1694, which resulted in another succession dispute that ended with assassination of Tian Thala, a short-lived King. By 1698, he attacked Vientiane, the very capital of Lan Xang at that time with the help of Vietnamese. By 1699, King Nan Tharat, another short-lived King and successor of Lan Xang was deposed by Setthathirah II. However, Prince Kitsarath denied the authority of Setthathirah II, his own cousin as he took over Luang Prabang to be his own domain. The invasion from Vientiane caused Luang Prabang asking Siam for a military aid. Alas, it caused Siam to recognize Luang Prabang as a kingdom while Lan Xang became Vientiane. Meanwhile, another grandson of Suliyavongsa, Prince Nokasad decided to use the divided state as an opportunity to declare his own domain in Champasak. The Principality of Muang Phuan however, though remained somewhat loyal to the previous Lan Xang Kingdom throughout the whole 17th century, decided to remained as a tributary state with the Luang Prabang. By early 19th century, the Vientiane who had been a Siamese vassal since the 1770’s, decided to rebel under the rule of King Anouvong in 1826 by sending 10,000 men against the Siamese. However, the Siamese army quickly counter-attack the Vientiane army, crushing them before marching to the capital of Vientiane in 1827. The region was sacked by the Siamese warriors, before completely annexed as part of Rattanakosin Kingdom in 1828.","",""

In order to protect themselves, they declared to be a tributary state to the Vietnamese under the Nguyen Dynasty. However, in 1800, King Inthavong of Vientiane, fearing the resurgence of power from the principality, decided to capture King Chao Somphou of Muang Phan until his death in 1803 as a prisoner. Chao Somphou was then replaced by Chao Noy, his own nephew who ruled in power and strong military authority to protect Muang Phuan. Accused by his half-brother of trying to declare rebellion, he was captured by King Anouvong of Vientiane for 3 years before released, which he then sought tributary relations with the Vietnamese, renewing the relations. Later, King Anouvong tried to escape from the Siamese army by seeking a refuge in Muang Phuan, which Chao Noy use the opportunity to handed him over for the Siamese army. His betrayal later judged by the Vietnamese as Emperor Minh Mang summoned him to explain his actions in 1830 (Vientiane was also considered a Vietnamese tributary state during that time). At the same time, Chao Noy refused to send the Vietnamese tributes which caused the dynasty to send his armies to Muang Phuan. Both Chao Noy and his families were captured and for 16 years, was under the Vietnamese custody with Chao Noy getting executed in 1831. Muang Phuan was effectively under Vietnamese administration by 1832.","",""

The rebellion done by the Vientiane in 1820’s caused Champasak to join in due to the ruler of Champasak during that time was Chao Nyo, the third son of Anouvong and Crown Prince of Vientiane. But since the defeat of Vientiane, it reduced Champasak into a vassalage under Siamese influence. Meanwhile the conflict between Cambodian and Siamese army from 1831 to 1834 along with Vietnamese intervention to establish their own dominance caused Champasak to switch as another vassal for the Nguyen Dynasty. Luang Prabang on the other hand, enjoyed a relative peace compared to their Lao counterparts, in which there will be no serious problems until mid to late 19th century. During King Chantharath of Luang Prabang’s reign, the Haw rebels (which migrated from China to modern day Laos) cause mayhem through raiding and looting the nearby temples. Yet it was during his rule where he managed to counter Vietnamese and Haw rebels’ threats, freeing Muang Phai as Luang Prabang reached its golden age under his rule before his death in 1870. Continuing the Luang Prabang’s rule, the state had become Siam’s greatest vassal and ally during times of need. Yet after the death of Chantharath in 1870, his successor, Oun Kham, was unable to fight back against the Black Flag Army from China along with bandits in his country. The French had formerly established a consulate in his realm since 1885, though it draws Siam’s worry about the annexation of Luang Prabang by the French. In 1886 however, Oun Kham asked for French protection against the Chinese rebels, which the French agreed much to the protests from Siam. Later during 1893 Franco-Siamese crisis, the French forced the Siamese to give up Luang Prabang and its Lao states, giving the French colonial control over it as the royals treated as nothing more but mere figureheads.","",""

King Suriyawong, also known as Chao Chiwit Ao, was a highly respected ruler of Chiang Mai, one of the Lanna vassals during his time. His rule managed to keep Chiang Ma stable and peaceful under the Siamese influence. He faced accusations from the other rulers, even got questioned in the court by the Siam King in which he turned it into an opportunity. Local chronicles stated that he gave gifts for the King (though denied) and convinced him that he was at no fault. Due to this, he returned home to govern his territories. Until his death, the Siamese couldn’t bring their influence to Chiang Mai, let alone interfere as they fear the powerful influence that Suriyawong possessed. He even forbade other religions other than Buddhism in his realm, executing two Christians by 1868, as his rule was a strict but stable one, bringing a period of peace. After his death, Chiang Mai was formally annexed by Rattanakosin in 1892.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1408473841688117389/1408474079849218088/image.png?ex=69968474&is=699532f4&hm=ec14ee12e1dbfa6031065eb008983ce1f23ecaa4b3b0824588f18c3571e003b0&",""

    The Kingdom of Luang Prabang, Champasak, Vientiane, and Muang Phai was ruled predominantly by Tai or Lao populace, while states in former Lan Na including Chiang Mai had a large Burmese and Mons populace in their realms. Each Lao state had its own hereditary ruler called a Chao (Prince or King), who assisted by his three principal officers known as uparat or upahat (the Westerners later recognized this officer to be the heir apparent or known as Second King), chao ratsavong, and chao ratsabut. Beneath these positions, there are four ministers who each been titled as princes too (Chao), and three senior officials known as phaya. A five-man council of advisors was seen in the court, being termed as senam. The administrative governance was split into provinces, district or cantons and at the lowest level: villages. The province was obviously ruled by a governor, districts or cantons by tasseng, and finally, villages under the headmen. The Siamese largely leave the administrative matters to be undisturbed for the Lao states at first. However, by 1875 the Siamese made new reforms which introduced commissioners to oversee the day-to-day governance inside these Lao states. During war, it was written that each chieftain shall be called by their Lao ruler to gathered at most: two-thirds of their own followers.","",""

Some men can be exempt from war service in order to supply the elephant, with others that gathered for war reportedly have at least one musket for each household (sometimes even lent those muskets, although many also brought spears and swords). During the war against Vientiane in 1828, the records had shown that Chiang Mai provided 5,000 men, Labong 3,000 men, Lagong 5,000 men, Nan 5,000 men, and Phrae 1,000 men (a total of 19,000 men being gathered from the Lao states). Some states possessed a very small standing army opposed to their large levy force. Chiang Mai for example, was only able to field about 1,500 standing army in 1824. Cases such as Luang Prabang, have their own royal rifle corps in 1892. Other example like Champasak, had a Siamese officer being sent to train their troops in 1888 as garrison forces, in which the Siamese only have no more than a few hundred men garrisoning these Lao states (from 1880’s to 1890’s).","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1408473841688117389/1408474216692711445/image.png?ex=69968495&is=69953315&hm=ce62ad56e15b69296916cd6147a67c2f47356290916a5c11b329ed2cbb814391&",""

    Within the first half of the century, the Laotians were using considerable numbers of crossbows along with their swords, spears and muskets. Reports from the 1840’s stated that the Laotians pretty have owned a lot of muskets, yet still avail themselves with the usage of bows. During the early 19th century, they owned a huge amount of Chinese-style matchlocks along with jingalls, directly imported from China. Yet in 1830’s, there were reportedly larger adoption of “old and dangerous” flintlock muskets amongst the Laotian arsenals. A few of them were made by the Lawa people, but the Laotians preferred English made musket, regardless of condition and age. Flintlock muskets gradually replaced with percussion caps by mid-19th century, eventually partly armed with breech-loaders by the Siamese arms in 1880’s. However, in parts of former Lanna, the Laotians still possessed large tower flintlocks which were very old and dangerous to use even in the 1880’s. All Laotian soldiers armed themselves with a sword or knife, with crossbows slowly being reduced to hunting roles except for a few hill-tribes. Very few artilleries can be reported from the Laotian states, as in 1829, the King of Labong claimed to have 30 guns in the capital, and 40 each in Lagong and Chiang Mai. However, later discovery by the observers proved that many guns were being buried and unserviceable, with Chiang Mai only have 5 to 6 guns in 1824, while other later record from 1837 stated that there are 4 iron guns of foreign castings.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1408473841688117389/1408474298812862554/image.png?ex=699684a9&is=69953329&hm=a376ef569a5b8482f7b54a63805580a76a5e1c794dfabeccbee0d3a18b47117f&",""

    The Laotian fighting followed the typical South East Asian pattern of night attacks, ambushes, raids and surprise attacks. European observers described the Laotians “quick of sight and hearing,” while creeping through the jungles in “in a surprising and quiet way.” All of the Laotian attacks were made during nights, as they never made an attempt to attack by daylight. And if they do fail, they will retreat before waiting for the better opportunity. Despite their specialties in wars, the Laotians were similar to their Shan cousins of being not particularly warlike. At the end of battles, should they emerge as victors of the wars, one aspect that need to be noted from every South East Asian traditional warfare, was the idea of depopulation policy. There were multiple reasons behind the policy itself, such as increasing the economic growth of the victor, preventing rebellion or possible resurgence in power from the enemies as revenge, etc. Examples of these events can be seen during the Siamese sack of Vientiane in 1828, in which many of its populace were allocated to areas that had been devastated by the wars with the Burmese. Such policy was so effective, that by 1850, the Vientiane had ¾ of its population being completely reduced. Mass slaughters were also done in order to reduce the potential populace being used for wars by the enemies, causing massacres by both the Siamese and Burmese. The Lao made some use of their elephants, in which depending on the region, some elephants were trained to carry four men armed with a jingall. Chiang Mai for example, have their own corps of elephant army. Other Lao states by large, only use their elephants to carry baggage than for active war usage. Lao cavalry however, was not mentioned in any sources with the only source for mounts existence was during the Siamese annexation of Vientiane, in which only 400 ponies were collected.","",""

The maintenance for the town fortifications can be considered to be quite poor, as originally, they were built strongly with the ditches enclosed the walls with the depth of 15 feets. Later on, the ditches became only 6 to 7 feet in depth. Their walls started to erode as time goes on, quickly falling in ruins with great portions of it toppled against one another (some even goes half-buried).

They were known to conduct various rebellions, including against the Laotians, Siamese and even the French, only to never be fully subdued by either of these three.

Forming semi-nomadic communities, they took up arms against the Siamese or Laotian authorities whenever they felt their independence had been threatened. Since the 1860’s, their migrations caused restlessness within the Vietnamese regions as series of revolts were launched by the Meo, until the French colonial authority tried to do some efforts by 20th century, one of them including the taking up of their arms in 1919 (which proved fruitless since they can make their own firearms through homemade methods).
