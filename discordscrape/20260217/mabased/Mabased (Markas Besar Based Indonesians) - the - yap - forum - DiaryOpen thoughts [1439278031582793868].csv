Where I argued about sola scriptura, though I still believe in the fact that of Christianity should be more disciplined, not in the terms of following the rules tightly, anyone makes mistakes now and then instead trying to follow them, though you shouldn't follow what you don't believe in. What I mean by this is to not allow people to just pass off problems or issues is bad for example concerning people who want to convert they want to be able to do things so they can delve in sin (alcohol. I don't think alcohol is bad just drunkenness) so they can do whatever they want or using the fact that Jesus loves everyone to pass of mistakes I think that's one of the biggest issues. Its the same way does a parent/a good friend allow their son/friend to go and do things that will hurt them or do they try to stop them from doing them. Now I don't believe in forcing people to act a certain way by commanding them, what you should do is presenting why its bad for them and talking them about it like presenting your ideas. Though if they still choose to do it you have to let them go no matter what, since it is their choice. The thing is to always be open in your arms to allow them to comeback if they want to.","",""
