It did not have to be blockchain, LLM, or any state-of-the-art techs. In fact, the simpler it is, the more likely it will be implemented. Who knows, there could be a certain framework/model to be proposed for audiensi with DPR - ""fingers-crossed"".","",""

- Emphasis on Plurality
- Radical Transparency
- Flexibility to re-roll Policy
NB: I make these terms myself to structure my thread.","",""

To formulate data for discussion during policy making, Social Media could 
be a very good place to collect initial data. But the problem is social media is very chaotic and people are going crazy in comments; trolls, buzzers, hate comments etc. To tackle this Taiwan ""delete"" the comment feature. 

They employ Polis with these steps:

1. Admin opens up a polis thread to discuss the matter at hand (e.g. What do you think of RUU TNI), add related references, then feeds initial suggestions. 
2. People get the link and vote Agree, Disagree and Pass on these initial suggestions that shows as stack of cards.
3. After voting people can submit their own suggestion and opinion and subscribe to the polling. During their free time the people can revisit the polling, vote and submit more opinions. 
4. Let the polling run for one month. Then grab the result and analyze.
5. Bring the most voted opinions/suggestions to be discussed in legislative meetings to formulate policy regarding the issue at hand.

If implemented in Indonesia, at least, our DPR has a set of suggestions by the people to discuss in their lavish rapat rather than cherry-pick opinions that they claim come from their constituents.

This is the tool they use:

Live-stream the whole policy making meetings.  Open pollings that direct policy making that everyone can monitor and involve in. 

AFAIK, the previous Taiwan Komdigi Minister only meet with people at working hour and insist the whole meeting is live-streamed and recorded. 

I do not have any other instances, but if you do please tell me more.","",""

This idea is strange in Indonesia. Usually after an Undang-Undang is enforced, and it needs to be revised it will need a very long bureaucratic processes and maneuvers; Gugat ke MK, New RUU, etc.

I don't know if any such thing ever happens in Taiwan, but they said they have a kind of ""probation"" period for the new policy for several months. If the new policy turns out to be bad, they could re-implement the old policy.  In case a new policy regarding the issue is really required, repeat the whole policy making process.","",""
