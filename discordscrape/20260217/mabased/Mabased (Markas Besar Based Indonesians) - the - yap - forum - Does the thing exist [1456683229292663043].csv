~ i said this just now

There is something so moral about someone who is nearly oblivious to the uniqueness of their totally flouting ideas of humor, perspective, and way of life, a genuine authenticity, borne from a disinterest in the many, rather an affinity for the few. This is genuine freedom. From an outsider perspective this kind of 'Freedom' embodied by the unique someone is treated as if it were a simple spectacle of amusement, the quagmire of the free. This freedom is a source of ridicule and an ants nest that most, in the conscious, avoid, others dare to play with the ants. In short, this freedom when viewed by the ever judging monocle of the outside is a nuisance, something that arises out of extreme societal flaw. 

But to the contrary, to the free, this freedom is the society, it is everything. It's often said that when the free are appreciated, they are no longer the bastions of freedom, but a new behemoth of conformity. When the free are acknowledged they are no longer ""free"" in any meaningful sense. Freedom is meant to be opposed it is the indicator, just how ""Good"" can only be when ""Ungood"" exist, but of course, this is very flawed. Free and Unfree exist as one, how we interact with the world we never encounter a black and white freedom and an obvious tyranny. The real world constitutes itself of ""phenomena"", phenomena where we can experience, the phenomena our experience create. 🩷🩷. Good and Ungood, as opposites are one. The real world is not constituted of the thing and its opposite (nothing), nothing as much as the 'thing', exist, as the 'thing' but it is nothing. How could nothing exist??? well why does the 'thing' exist, from that the question of the nothing can be answered. To acknowledge the nothing as a thing in its own right, is to acknowledge the subjective understanding of the self, as a thing, responsive, ever changing, reflective, but not 'static' 📺.","",""

There is a tendency to segregate the thing and the nothing, as if the self doesn't paint both as, well, the thing and the nothing. But is to acknowledge the nothing as a thing in its own right, a simultaneous opposition to the 'thing' ? No. There is just something bigger that encompasses the thing and the nothing (Not God). The nothing isn't a 'thing' because there is some'thing' that proceed it (a mask) like how Zero is the mascot of nothing, but in that process it is some'thing'. This is not the direction of the thing and nothing. If put in contrast a 'thing' always leads back to nothing. What is the opposite of cold according to the experience of humans? Well obv, hot, but to feel-know/know-feel cold itself, experience is the front key, so the opposite of cold might as well be nothing. What is the opposite of blue? it certainly cannot be any color that preceded or proceed it 📘📕 because that is an impossibility, where does one color end and another begin, but just as the thing and the nothing exist in harmony, the impossible and the possible does also. Say blue ends when it is no longer blue, red begins when it is no longer blue. 

This nothing is so significant. to systematically categorize the thing and the nothing is cruel! its as if to separate the chick from the hen! 🐣 not to say that nothing is merely an attribute of the thing, a mere property of the thing.","",""
