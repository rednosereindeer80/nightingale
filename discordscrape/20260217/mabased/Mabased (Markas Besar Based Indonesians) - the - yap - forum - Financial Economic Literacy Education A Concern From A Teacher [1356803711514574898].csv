So, suffice to say, I taught quite a number of students from private schools during my time teaching them as a bimbel teacher. There is already a few problems to begin with when I was assigned to the job itself. For starter, there isn't enough teachers who mastered economy, sociology or other social subjects to begin with. Most of the teachers, solely focusing themselves in Science, Maths, Chemistry, Biology and Indonesian language. I was one of the only few who actually have the knowledge in economy, at least by basic levels. Then I started to teach 7th graders who told me all their struggles and problems inside their own schools one by one. A few stated that they have a Filipino teacher teaching them economy, but with many are still lacking in their English grammars, when the standard is raised to a Cambridge or Oxford standard, it is enough to get them confused about the subjects. Most tell me a similar story that they cannot understand the complex grammar and terms that is being taught in class. From the terms ""scarcity,"" ""supply and demand,"" ""interest rate,"" and even ""elasticity,"" these terms are hard to understand for many early 7th graders, let alone during the test, there is a trend where the teachers intentionally make these questions have complex or advanced level of English language. This is where I realized Indonesian students are generally not used to advanced grammars, even when they are rich students that have the proper education since elementary in English. Furthermore problems I've noticed is that when they started to get confused, they are getting  even more confused on how to answer it without proper guidance. Thus, this is where they become ""lazy.""","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-02T01:33:58.0020000+00:00","They stopped learning since they are confused, with many even just memorized for the sake of using their memory only to answer questions in the test, when the real learning is not through memory, but through an understanding. But that goes back to the problem, how will they understand if they didn't know the grammars and its terms to begin with? I want to blame the teacher for this but as  I saw the teacher is being Filipino, I can understand why he/she put such standard. Philippines' English standard may or may not have been advanced to begin with, possibly even more than normal Indonesian standard for English, thus why he/she might think the Indonesian students can cope with it (which is not really the case). So what I can do now is to simply help them understand these terms one by one through manual translations. Then another problem came in: answering economic questions using KAAE method (Knowledge, Application, Analysis and Evaluation). Basically every time you answered one of the economic questions in essay, you have to write some long words for an answer, which most are struggling with it.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-02T01:34:10.1810000+00:00","It took students that have natural talents or actually being heavily attentive to write some decent answers, while the average Indonesian students that I've met, struggled a lot in adapting to it. They don't even know what is knowledge, application, analysis and evaluation to begin with. They mainly can only understand if there is a common pattern, so I decided to give them more examples, which thankfully, a few started to get it right. But just like many normal students back in school days, I have to remind them otherwise by a few days, they will forget it again. Then when it comes to 8th graders along with 9th graders, some of them suffered the same fate too. They forget what they learn, and I have to taught them from some of the basics in economy (even as basic as law of demand and supply & how to read a graph). Furthermore, in some private schools, they already added extra subject that is related to economy such as business study and e-commerce (online commerce). This is true for some 7th graders and 10th graders that I've faced during my bimbel class, in which they themselves were confused when facing these subjects. Some can use their logic in answering these subjects right, but others still face similar struggles. I realized the 3 main problems when teaching these students after only 9 months of being a bimbel teacher: (1) Bad teacher, (2) English literacy, and (3) Memorization. These 3 main problems usually caused these students to simply recognize economic subject mainly through its rough surface but never fully understand it.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-02T01:34:32.3950000+00:00","When I try to test them by asking them about certain economic situation that requires mainly economic logic (usually being the suggested policies for the business situation and such), many are still confused then took a long silent time to answer it. I never judged them for not being able to, in fact I do appreciate their honesty for not knowing things then asking me back, which I answered to them with simplified answers. But this gave a huge concern to me as an economic teacher for them, as this subject can be pretty important for them to understand the economic situation, even when it comes to reading news. I saw a lot of people tend to make assumptions with economic situations, with some (not all) make ""cocoklogi"" assumptions while ignoring the economic logic behind it (which I can see the tendency for it). Worse, I can see the burdens are also put with the teachers, as they themselves struggle with what they are trying to teach. I even heard the students' testimonies, telling me that some of their teachers literally (and shamelessly), use ChatGPT to answer the questions that they were supposed to be answering according to the related subjects. For me, this is fatal when it comes to economic lesson. It requires some basic understanding as a foundation, before you can reach other foundations first.","",""

This also gave a new problem faced by many Indonesian students, especially Gen Alpha: our younger and current generation is not ready nor literate enough in financial or economic literacy. And as  a teacher, it concerns me very much, though I only do my best by trying to teach these early junior high students. Many times I didn't even pushed them to do homeworks, instead I asked them more verbally then they answered for them to actually experiences critical thinking for the first time (at some point we even have meme competitions after I am done with my teaching, where they even taught me their brainrot languages along with their memes).

Sometimes I've faced parents who are pretty perfectionist (middle class for most of the time), demanding that their son/daughter should become a top in their classes. I tried to explain to them that it isn't possible without them actually trying to become one or using their full capacity to do so. Education cannot be forced, but should be understood for one to attain its full learning. But knowing the current curriculum and my experience as a student, everything was pretty much (and normalized) to be forced. Prejudice against the students who are slow learners do exist, with some are slow not because they are lazy, but because they are disabled themselves. It is unfair to put these students into the same method as the others as I taught a few who actually have ADHD or Hyperactive personality. I tried to cope with them by actually playing with their games then inserted a few subjects, which actually worked to make them learn one or two things about the subject (at the very least).","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-02T01:40:42.5440000+00:00","All in all, there are a lot of struggles for me in teaching these students. Do I found myself exhausted at some point? Yes, a few times I did. But do I regret it? No, I never regretted it as I just need a few rest then come back being refreshed to teach them again once more. I myself find teaching to be pretty laidback when I simply taught them not based on rutinity, but my passion to tell them about stories as examples related to the subject. This include sociology, history, PKN, etc.","",""

As a teacher for 7th graders, whom are pretty close to my students as well till the end of their first and second semester *(god im gonna miss them, waaa)*, the inability for them to understand on the subject matter are felt across the room. The first time I enter the class and taught them about English education (early merdeka curriculum) I notice not all of them gets the subject or the proper understanding on the material, so I shifted between different teaching methods with the first being regular, dull way of teaching to something more playful and attributing games so that they could understand. Through this method, they finally get it.","",""

Most were praises, while the minority ones (whom I considered to be the ones more aware of the issues) says their gratitudes to me for being such a good teacher. This made my heart break deeply, but with a kind smile, I just thanked them for being such wonderful students.

Second semester, honestly my roughest one different to the elementary, the materials are excruciating and these materials have to be explained in a bit more detail for them to finally understand what's going on and what's the meaning of this and that (they are still confused but I hope they get it), I had to... spin and act and do a little ballet dance and... Honestly alot of hand gestures, body gestures and footwork to express the TRUE MEANING OF THE SENTENCE in order for them to understand (took me an hour which is wasteful...) But in the end, by the end of the final semester tests, and the end of my voluntary work there, I asked the same questions the same way I asked them in first semester.","",""
