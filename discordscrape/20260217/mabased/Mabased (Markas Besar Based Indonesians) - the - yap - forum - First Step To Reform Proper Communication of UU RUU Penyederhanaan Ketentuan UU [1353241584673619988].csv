I believe it is important for us Indonesian lawmakers and policymakers to simplified the words and literacy that is written in our policies. To start with, we can reduce the requirements for UU to be at least 900 pages in itself. We can reduce that requirement to 100 pages by minimum. In this way, we can have a much more proper and simplified display for our people to read it easily than having to tortured themselves reading 900 pages of UU.

Moreover, there should be a creation for a ""special team"" formed by the government, consisted of government's representative, law experts and academicians, and civil representatives. The time limit for the simplifying shall be about 12 months or a year. By the time they failed to compiled it together by 12 months, it can be deemed to be unconstitutional or not officially recognized as a proper law. Punishments shall exist for those who tried to prevent it or failures on the team's part through administrative means.

For this, I formed my own RUU that could be seen and revised by anyone should it be interesting to find a solution for our laws to be properly communicated to our people, not only by socializing attempts, but through policies that will allow it to do so.

This is simply the first few baby steps that I believe can be agreeable by both sides: the government and its people. It will reduce more time to officially recognize a law, while allowing the people have easier time to read the laws that the government had officially enacted as a universal policy in the future.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353241584673619988/1353241584820289716/Rancangan_Undang-Undang_Republik_Indonesia_Tentang_Penyederhanaan_Ketentuan_Undang-Undang.pdf?ex=6995f92f&is=6994a7af&hm=abe4f0bffbebc60bda3743bbc3e556683e81f683c510c21d56fbe49535880015&","👍 (2)"

1. In terms of public participation, UU 12/2011  stipulates public participation diatur di Perpres 87/2014, Perpres 76/2021. 

Art. 176-187 of Perpres 87/2014 requires proleg on all level to be distributed to the public. Art. 188 of Perpres 87/2014 then further requires public participation to be mandatory for penyusunan proleg nasional/prov/daerah, but Art. 188 specifically stipulates the detail for public participation di Permen (Permenkumham).

2. Details on public participation can also be seen on Peraturan DPR, and the bulk of it semi covered under Art. 46-47.

3. For the formatting rule for Naskah Akademik, see Appendix I of UU 12/2011. Structuring is on Appendix II.

 Art. 96 further stipulates the public's right to provide written feedback (public meeting, field visit, socialization, seminar, etc) for RUU.
