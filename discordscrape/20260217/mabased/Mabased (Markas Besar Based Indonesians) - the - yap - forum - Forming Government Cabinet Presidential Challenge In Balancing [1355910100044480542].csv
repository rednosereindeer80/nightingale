Let's say you managed to win over the campaign with your party gained some good grounds and percentage votes, great, now you are faced with another challenge: balancing the cabinet. If your party managed to win with supermajority as a lone political party, you might not feel the need to share your seats that much. But for most of the time, political parties will band together to form a coalition, then win over the votes to shared the seats according to the deals that had been agreed upon. Even if you win over the election, if majority of your DPR for example are from opposition parties, there is a huge chance your proposal for reforms will be rejected by the DPR if they formed a unified coalition against your presidency. In some cases, should a scandal be formed then weaponized against you, impeachment is also possible. There are a few ministries inside the cabinets that are suggested to be mindful when giving it to a certain member or party, as these positions grant power or influence to that person or party.  These positions include:
- Minister of Justice (manage HKI (Hak Kekayaan Intelektual), ormas, prisoners (including political prisoners), political party (its rights), and various institutions. Possibly in a few cases, it can changed ministry of laws' staffs into loyalist of the President or his own party)
- Minister of Defense (access to manage strategic planning, military resources, along with international relations with other countries in military. It can grant the individual to empower certain military figures & staffs to either favoring President's loyalists or his own party)
- Minister of Finance (self-explainable, it controlled the financing of the government's spending & purchase)
- Minister of Interior (managing the police institutions & local governments, becoming the center of security inside the nation)","","👍 (2)"

For example, if a party advocated for social reforms, chances are, they will ask for ministries that handled social reforms and changes. Thus you have to convinced them to take these ministries. In many cases, political parties always aimed for these 4 ministry positions due to their significant political power that it grants them. From installing their own people, allocating resources, creating then propose RUU, while planning for the strategic plans inside these sectors. People who retrieved one of these 4 ministries can be regarded to be more influential than the other ministries suffice to say. Thus in some cases, government will tend to leave them for independent candidates instead of political in cases of political parties disapproving any candidates that president proposes even from his own party.","",""

Cases of using government properties for political party's usage is not really uncommon. It happen many times but covered for most of the time, even for other democratic countries.","",""

Should the cabinet fail, their reputation will tend to be in shambles, giving other political parties that are not in the cabinet a chance to gain further popularity for the next election with their own candidates.","",""
