Potential Meeting Points:

    ""Kerakyatan yang Dipimpin oleh Hikmat Kebijaksanaan dalam Permusyawaratan/Perwakilan"" (Democracy Guided by Inner Wisdom in Deliberations/Representation):
        This principle emphasizes decision-making through deliberation and people's representation.
        The policy market mechanism in futarchy can be seen as a form of public participation in decision-making, provided it is regulated transparently and fairly.
    ""Keadilan Sosial bagi Seluruh Rakyat Indonesia"" (Social Justice for All Indonesian People):
        This principle emphasizes the equitable distribution of welfare and justice for all citizens.
        Futarchy can be used to measure and evaluate the impact of policies on social justice, provided the metrics used reflect Pancasila values.","",""
"143747199677890561","yo_yoji","2025-03-21T15:34:55.5670000+00:00","Challenges and Adjustments:

    Abstract Pancasila Values:
        Some Pancasila values, such as ""Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa"" (Belief in One Supreme God) or ""Kemanusiaan yang adil dan beradab"" (Just and Civilized Humanity), are difficult to measure quantitatively.
        Efforts are needed to translate these values into relevant and measurable metrics, while maintaining the essence of Pancasila.
    Potential for Inequality:
        The market mechanism in futarchy can reinforce inequality if not properly regulated.
        Mechanisms are needed to ensure that all citizens have equal access to the policy market, and that the interests of minority groups are protected.
    Corruption and Manipulation:
        The risk of corruption and manipulation of the policy market needs to be anticipated.
        A strict oversight and regulatory system is needed to prevent abuse of power.
    Education and Participation:
        The public needs to have a good understanding of Pancasila and futarchy to participate effectively.
        Extensive education and socialization efforts are needed to raise public awareness and participation.

Conclusion:

    Integrating futarchy with Pancasila requires a careful and contextual approach.
    It is important to ensure that the principles of futarchy are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the values of Pancasila and the interests of the Indonesian nation.
    It is important to remember, that Pancasila is the final basic of the nation, and can not be replaced by another ideology.
    In other words, the implementation of futarchy ideology, must be thoroughly adjusted to the values that exist in the ideology of Pancasila.","",""

    Main Differences:
        Voting: Decisions are made based on the number of votes.
        Trading (Futarchy): Decisions are made based on market prices that reflect collective opinion through trading activity.
    Trading Mechanisms in Futarchy:
        Involves prediction markets where participants buy and sell ""shares"" representing potential outcomes of decision options.
        Market prices serve as an aggregate signal of collective belief about the best option.
    Advantages of Trading Over Voting:
        Reflects the intensity of preferences.
        Aggregates information better.
        Provides incentives for accuracy.
        Flexible and adaptable.
    Deliberation (Musyawarah) in the Context of Futarchy:
        Can complement trading mechanisms.
        Can be used before trading (to establish metrics), after trading (to interpret results), and in the oversight of futarchy.
    Challenges of Manipulation and Bias:
        Both futarchy and voting are vulnerable to manipulation and bias.
        Futarchy has the potential to aggregate information more efficiently, but requires careful design and oversight.
    Steps to Address Challenges:
        Strict market regulations.
        Education and literacy.
        Transparency.
        Careful system design.

In summary, futarchy offers an alternative approach to decision-making that leverages the wisdom of the crowd through trading mechanisms. While it has its own challenges, it also has the potential to produce more accurate and satisfactory decisions compared to traditional voting.","",""

- The efficient market hypothesis is an ideal condition, which is hard to prove because the real stock market is less than ideal. Moreover, the EMH comes with a set of predefined assumptions from the CAPM theory, which do not have ground to be executed in the real market. For example, CAPM assumes that individuals are price-takers (not market-makers), investors are rational beings and rely on optimising the mean-variance of their portfolio, or that information is costless and available to all traders. Behavioural finance disputes this.
- Causality and conditionality. The ideal futarchy method begs the question of whether the policy aims for the measures we’re trying to achieve.
- Temporal discounting. How far can we measure the success of the policy, to do what it claims to do? The execution could also introduce other variables and make it stray from the original outline.
- Poverty-affected cognitive biases: the wisdom of the rich (plutocracy). Unlike normal voting in presidential elections, voting in futarchy requires the voters to part with some of their assets, as it requires the act of buying or selling. This limits the participation of those under the poverty line where their main priority is to use their assets to survive, lest on voting.
- Thin markets. For the betting market to work, it requires liquid trading pairs instead of the thin market where prices sway in higher slippage.","",""

Prediction markets can be manipulated by wealthy individuals, corporations, or interest groups. If a group has the financial means, they can place large bets to sway the market’s expectations, leading to policies that benefit them rather than the general public.

2. Defining “National Welfare” is Subjective

Futarchy relies on a clear, quantifiable metric for national welfare, but societies rarely agree on a single definition. Economic growth, happiness, environmental sustainability, and social justice often conflict with one another, making it impossible to optimize a single measure without unintended consequences.

3. Misaligned Incentives and Short-Term Thinking

Prediction markets work best when forecasting near-term, quantifiable outcomes. However, many important policies (e.g., climate change, education reform) have long-term impacts that are difficult to measure in the short term. Markets may favor policies that produce immediate gains while ignoring long-term risks.

4. Lack of Accountability and Moral Considerations

Futarchy shifts decision-making from elected officials to market participants, reducing democratic accountability. Markets do not have moral or ethical considerations—only financial ones. This could lead to policies that are efficient but socially or morally unacceptable.

5. Overestimation of Market Rationality

Markets are not always rational. Financial crises, speculative bubbles, and mass panic demonstrate that markets can make poor predictions. If futarchy depends on markets to always make the best decisions, it ignores real-world evidence of market failures.

6. Complexity and Implementation Challenges

Implementing futarchy would require a highly sophisticated prediction market infrastructure, widespread public trust, and the ability to prevent fraud. Real-world governance is already complicated, and adding another layer of complexity would likely create inefficiencies rather than solve them.","",""

Hence why I have the feeling that futarchy gov model will fit perfectly with our society when I read it, because its ideology was born from decentralization movement instigated by Satoshi Nakamoto, that has the similar characteristics of the ""Messiah"" and our Nation.

However, it's implementation in Indonesia is difficult, hardly. The model assumes strong capitalist institutions in the form of developed financial markets and speculative trading culture, which are not fully observable in Indonesia's economic development. Furthrermore, the success of futarchy depends on the availability of information to the public and the uptake of decision markets. In Indonesia, barriers to reliable information and financial capability may limit participation to a few well-heeled individuals, thus embedding existing social inequalities. This is in line with 'info traps' and the risk of market manipulation in thinly traded markets. Hence, although theoretical justification can be found for futarchy, its realizability in Indonesia is hindered by institutional and informational factors.","","💯 (1)"

Let's start with the good parts of the ideology:

1. Market Based Decision Making
This can be a good progress if any government wishes to get good profitable outcome, at least by short term effect to gain confidence of the populace and government. Rather than having representative democracy to decide it, the markets decide it with the policymakers legalized it based on the market predictions. This would mean there is a need of revamp for data governance including people collecting datas, making predictions and results. Thus we do need more economists inside our office as stafsus.

2. Potential Market Growth
There is a good potential should it work well, as Indonesia could become one of the countries that experienced rapid growth through this system for the first time in history. And like some people stated: it is a high risk high reward system. It will be an interesting to see people getting protectionist but Indonesia become market driven country instead. 

Although this is where I must pointed out challenges that is needed to be addressed should all of us really want to achieve it:

1. Market Manipulation
These days datas can be faked and written out, especially election results. Thus it is not possible to see market predictions being faked out in favor for certain groups. Digitalization along with transparency could be beneficial in countering this, but again, in order to pass it, you still need the approval of the legislatures along with your own groups. That is a political problem you needed to address should anyone wanted to make it a reality.

2. Political & Public Resistance:
This is just a cultural problem since majority of our people are not used to such system before. Oppositions could try to undermine this ideology in the name of democracy. You can however, try to frame them as reactionaries along with making their images look unpopular in front of the public.","","👍 (1)"

3. Short-Term Market Maximization
By long term, many leaders or oligarchs can potentially use this system to gain public confidence. There is a need to make legacy out of their leadership. Thus it can create a trend where they relied on datas to grant them short term economic boost without focusing much in long term.  It can, and without regulations, creating further inequality if not careful since they care more about results by physical forms than waiting for long term results.","",""

It is not about when you achieved it, but how do you defend it when you achieved such government during short term years. I fear that this ideology will face heavy amount of resistance from various groups during its early rise to power, which if you or someone else could properly address it, then solve it, it might establish stability that you longed for in the future. But even by long term, regulations and reviews should always be checked, which sadly, none of us will live that long to always keep in check or whether new groups or power can enter our government, so always prepare a good successor to protect it.","",""

The issue is, economics is not a natural science, as in natural science, if I were to propose the hypothesis of A+B = C, then all the variables of A and B should be correct. However, as the economy is an unpredictable force, it is impossible for such a hypothesis to be proposed in economics and be correct. This is why, in early economics, praxeology and logical deduction were about the only drivers of innovation within the study. As anything else is simply just an intellectual confusion, we take, for example, if two people were to exchange things voluntarily, both of them have to believe that it is profitable for both of them. I don't need to use empirical evidence to support this, any logical deduction would lead to the conclusion that this is indeed correct.

On the point of government intervention, yes, i do agree that it's  government intervention, universally, that causes distortions and that the free market is fine. However, in a futarchy, interventions are favoured as having those economists in power to figure out what to do with the economy is sort of signalling the need for intervention, no matter how small.","",""

Economics deals with complex systems, but so do fields like meteorology or biology, where empirical data and modelling still yield useful predictions despite uncertainty. Futarchy leverages prediction markets, which aggregate collective knowledge to forecast outcomes. These markets don’t rely solely on deductive logic or empirical models but on the wisdom of crowds, where participants bet on outcomes based on their insights. Studies, like those by economist Robin Hanson, show prediction markets often outperform expert forecasts in areas like elections or economic trends. For example, the Iowa Electronic Markets have consistently predicted U.S. presidential election outcomes more accurately than polls. By incorporating diverse perspectives, futarchy sidesteps the limitations of both rigid praxeological assumptions and flawed empirical models, offering a dynamic way to approximate truth in economics.

2. While it’s true that economics’ unpredictability makes hypothesis testing (like A+B=C) impossible and that human behaviour introduces variability, this doesn’t render economic forecasting futile. Prediction markets in futarchy thrive on uncertainty by letting participants bet on specific outcomes, such as GDP growth or policy impacts. These markets adjust in real time as new information emerges, unlike static deductive models or slow empirical studies. For instance, if a policy is proposed, futarchy’s markets would estimate its impact on measurable metrics (e.g., employment or inflation). The aggregated bets reflect a range of knowledge, from logical reasoning to data-driven insights, making it more robust than praxeology alone. Your argument’s reliance on logical deduction overlooks the power of collective intelligence, which futarchy harnesses to navigate economic complexity.","",""

It doesn’t tell us how markets scale, how preferences shift, or how external factors (like taxes or regulations) affect outcomes. Futarchy’s prediction markets build on this principle by letting participants reveal their preferences through bets, providing a broader and more actionable understanding of economic behaviour. For example, if two people trade, a futarchy market could predict the broader impact of similar trades on a market or society, incorporating factors like supply, demand, or trust—elements praxeology might oversimplify. By combining deductive insights with real-world signals, futarchy offers a more comprehensive approach than logical deduction alone.

4. Your argument’s strongest critique is that futarchy signals a need for government intervention by empowering economists to guide economic decisions. This misinterprets futarchy’s mechanics. In futarchy, proposed by Robin Hanson, policies are chosen based on prediction market outcomes, not economists’ directives. The markets decide which policies maximise desired outcomes (e.g., economic growth or public welfare), and government’s role is to implement these, not to dictate them. Far from encouraging intervention, futarchy can align with free-market principles. If markets predict that minimal government involvement leads to better outcomes, futarchy would favour non-interventionist policies. For instance, a prediction market could show that deregulation boosts GDP more than subsidies, guiding policy without requiring top-down control. The argument assumes futarchy inherently leans toward intervention, but in practice, it’s agnostic—it follows the data, not the biases of economists or officials.","",""

This is a point futarchy can address effectively. By using prediction markets to evaluate policies, futarchy reduces reliance on centralised planning, which often leads to inefficiencies. Unlike traditional systems where bureaucrats or economists impose solutions, futarchy lets market participants—potentially anyone—signal what works best. This decentralised approach aligns with the argument’s preference for free markets, as it minimises distortions caused by arbitrary interventions. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, prediction markets could have tested whether bailouts or market-driven solutions would better stabilise the economy, bypassing the biases of policymakers. Futarchy thus offers a mechanism to keep interventions minimal and evidence-based, countering your argument’s concern about government overreach.

6. Futarchy’s strength lies in its ability to combine the best of both worlds: the logical insights of praxeology and the real-world data of empirical methods. Prediction markets incentivise participants to reveal truthful information through financial stakes, unlike economists who might be swayed by ideology or incomplete data. By focusing on measurable outcomes (e.g., GDP, employment), futarchy avoids the “intellectual confusion” your argument attributes to mainstream economics, offering a transparent and adaptable system. Moreover, futarchy doesn’t require perfect predictability. It thrives in uncertainty by continuously updating based on new bets and information, unlike rigid deductive models or slow empirical studies.","",""
