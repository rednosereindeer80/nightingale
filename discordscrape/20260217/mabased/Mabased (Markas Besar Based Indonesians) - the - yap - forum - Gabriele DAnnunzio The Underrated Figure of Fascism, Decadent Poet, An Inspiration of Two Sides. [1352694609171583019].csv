Gabriele D'Annunzio, a known literary figure, turned war hero after WW1, whom some had called him "" il Vate"" (the Poet) and ""il Profeta"" (the Prophet) for his charismatic works in his literatures, was one of the forgotten yet profound figure in fascism. Many considered him to be both the inspiration that Mussolini followed later on with his aesthetics, with other emphasized its influences to the Italian Socialists and their early resistance against fascism in Italy. His political history was a complex one too, he never declared himself a fascist, yet credited to invented fascism and preaching about nationalism. He had stated a few progressive ideas of the left against the illiberal and reactionary policies made by man such as Luigi Pelloux for example (Though Mussolini also used to be a socialist until he got expulsed from his party then turned 180 degrees on his own ideology). 

Before his retirement, he was a short-lived dictator of Fiume as he led 186 grenadiers of the Royal Italian Army's 2nd Grenadiers Regiment's I Battalion to Fiume, only to gather more men along his way to finally capture the region while expulsing the rest of the allied forces. He tried to give Fiume to Italy but denied, later on declared Fiume as an independent state. He even planned to create an alternative League of Nations while inviting nations that are similarly oppressed (like Ireland, and other separatist groups in the Balkans like Slavic & Albanians) yet failed at the end when the Italian navy bombarded his territories after mere 5 days of fighting (he even declared war on Italy before that as a self-claimed ruler of Fiume). He retired after that only to be ennobled the title as Prince of Montenevoso by the King Emmanuel III of Italy, then died of stroke by 1938.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1352694609171583019/1352694609502928947/fc261dbc-0473-48ec-ac52-579dcf4712c9-1360x2040.png?ex=69969ec6&is=69954d46&hm=19c72be88e6e26ffaad3e9c0086b0710659b999c7d07e8f10cb98810095cdc9c&",""
