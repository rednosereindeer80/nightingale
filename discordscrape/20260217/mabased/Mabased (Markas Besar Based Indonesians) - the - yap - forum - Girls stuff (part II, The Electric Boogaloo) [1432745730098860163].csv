That's quite rich coming from a guy who's never been in a relationship but I'm just a little worried if things just don't work out because we'd be too different. I just hope someone would tell me if my preferences are okay.

I guess language would be one thing, as a person who speaks English as a first language. I'm not saying that I wouldn't date anyone who doesn't speak it fluently or I couldn't speak Malay fluently. It's just that I'd rather have our chemistry flow really well and it seems English just feels like a more natural language to me. So English fluency (especially native-level fluency) is a bonus, but not a dealbreaker. I just wonder if this criteria is too much.

Mainstream pop culture is not my forte. I don't listen to whatever's on the charts, I don't follow a lot of trends, I don't watch a lot of movies or TV shows. So it feels a little isolating having certain niches. Obviously she would be okay if she's into all that stuff, I just wish she'd put up with my own niches and (relatively but not very) weird niches.

Personality-wise, I have no clue. I sometimes describe it as ""quirky without trying too hard to be quirky"" but it feels a little condescending to say so. It's something I could read, like ""oh she's pretty interesting, I wanna know more about her"" (which is probably how infatuations work so this whole paragraph is f--king stupid). 

I gotta admit, I do like someone and it's not Maria this time. I figured we'd be awesome if we would stay as friends and I got over her. She used to be in the same English club as I do, she's now a college librarian and she doesn't seem to change much. I think she's pretty cute, but she doesn't acknowledge it yet. I'm hoping to hang out with her more and maybe a wholesome bond may blossom. No guarantees though.

TLDR: I got preferences and I'm catching feelings for someone who fits, wish me luck","",""

Putting up with your niches is also a must. Don’t compromise yourself for others, and that includes your partner, because your niches are you

Personality is completely up to you, as long as you don’t feel uncomfortable

Last but not least, there’s no strategy in trying to get closer to someone","",""
