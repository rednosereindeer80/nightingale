https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/15191143?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid

It is similar to inputting your email to Mozilla Monitor/have I been pwned to check whether your data breach or not, but continuous and you can ask more.

You can set any of your personal data you wish to have this service monitor, and whenever your data pop-up in dark-web, you will get notified.

PS: remember, it also means you give your personal data to Google, but alas whom else we should trust our data with?

After setting it, do tell me what you think of the result, okay?","",""
