Issue
-Indonesia is facing a job crisis. About 800,000 Indonesians remain unemployed due to bad education, work quality, poor labor laws, and bad business policies that prevent the private sector to grow and hire workers. For the past three months, there has been demonstrations in the street demanding the government to step in and fix the job crisis. There is also AI stepping into industries and completely eliminating the need for the human element which contributes to the issue.
-The Indonesian government is facing a public communication issue. The general public trusts the opinions and the news coming from influencers and content creators than the government which fuels resentment against the government. The government must work to fix communication and build trust towards the general public.
-Indonesia is suffering from economic inequality. The Indonesian economy is growing, but bad trickle down policies and incompetent welfare guarantees create a massive wealth gap between the rich and the poor inside the Indonesian government. A month ago, a large demonstration of students and laborers were met with repressive action from the authorities. If this is not dealt with soon it could lead to more riots and a possible revolution. The people are demanding reformation, evaluation and rooting out of corruption. There's also a decreasing in investment.
-There's a growing radical movement. Due to economic hardships, there are growing amounts of people who embrace far left ideas and far right ideas for politics and economy. The government must work to either pacify the populace through policy and governance or crush this dissent.
-The US and China tensions over Asia-Pacific is rising. Indonesia is stuck between having to side with the US or China with two countries holding leverage over Indonesia.","",""

-7,000 are poisoned due to bad Free Lunch Meals roll out. At the start of his presidency, President @Kim desired to roll out the Free Lunch program and promised thousands of families that they won't have to burden themselves with buying lunch anymore. The program is given over control to Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd who is responsible for setting the core of the policy through heavy government intervention and Minister of Domestic Affairs @Tota Genkai who is responsible for the deployment of food at schools. The government must either address this problem, stop the roll outs, re-evaluate or completely cut funding which will harm President Kim's credibility.
-A separatist force over at Kalimantan fights a war against the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government has been fighting against the Borneo Liberation Front since 2024. They demand West Kalimantan to secede from the Republic of Indonesia. Fighting has been going for two years with 800 Indonesian soldiers dead, and 2,000 injured. Minister of Defense @Yoska ( Your Mughal Vizier ) has been a strong proponent against this separatist movement and voices his displeasure in public, while Chief of Military @YuuRu has been accused of incompetence and corruption despite only receiving marching orders and equipment from the Minister of Defense. Minister of Finance @Universe Janitor also has been accused of prolonging the war by continuing to budget the military operation. A resolution either peaceful or forceful is needed to break this crisis.
Current steps:
President needs to lay down administration agendas
President and Minister of Finance must allocate budget for ALL of the government bodies.
Ministers and parliament members can lobby the President or Minister of Finance for bigger budgets

FAILURE TO ALLOCATE BUDGET IN THREE REALTIME DAYS WILL RESULT IN A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN","",""

For example: 
> Indonesia is facing a job crisis. About 800,000 Indonesians remain unemployed due to bad education, work quality, poor labor laws, and bad business policies that prevent the private sector to grow and hire workers.

Do players have access to census data on the demographic of unemployed indonesians (which city? how many in each city? education level?) as well as data on businesses and the current job market distribution in the country (which jobs are in overcrowded and therefore too competitive to support the surplus of labor, etc)?

> 7,000 are poisoned due to bad Free Lunch Meals roll out. At the start of his presidency, President @Kim desired to roll out the Free Lunch program and promised thousands of families that they won't have to burden themselves with buying lunch anymore. The program is given over control to Minister of Economy @truffle | gekoloniseerd who is responsible for setting the core of the policy through heavy government intervention and Minister of Domestic Affairs @Tota Genkai who is responsible for the deployment of food at schools.

Again, how much data do the players have with this issue? do they have data on:
- Number of schools in the cities the MBG programs are running on
- Number of students in each schools
- Number of MBG kitchens, performance data (good food quality or below standard? any news on poisoning associated with the kitchen?), which schools they provide sustenance for, budget allocated for each kitchen, etc

I'll use the MBG as an example for a issue to write a scenario on.
Let's say a minister wants to set a food standard to prevent food poisoning as well as to actually feed proper food to the population.

Now, all the schools will be provided a list of menus that they should provide to students every day under a set budget. The performance of all kitchens will then be ranked using the following criteria: 
1. How many students actually gets the food at the required standard in each school
2. How many cases of poisoning are recorded in each school (if exists)
3. The price-to-portion ratio of the food in a region (e.g. a kitchen in Jakarta may need to spend 25k on a portion of the same menu that costed 15k in Surabaya)

The minister could then focus on solving the problems **only** on problematic areas and worst performing regions instead of on all kitchens as a whole.

Now, instead of trying to make a plan and rolling a D20 for this single issue, the scenario breaks it into multiple problems in smaller areas and allows the player to instead make multiple D20 checks for each area/region.

Can a player do this?","",""

I think allocating IDR 150 B for the parliament is **absurdly high**. The following are numbers I found on the budget allocation of (real life) Indonesia for the parliament as well as the national treasury budget:

[DPR Dapat Jatah Anggaran Belanja Rp 9,9 Triliun dari APBN](https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-8071158/dpr-dapat-jatah-anggaran-belanja-rp-9-9-triliun-dari-apbn)
> Dalam Buku II Nota Keuangan 2026, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR) mendapat alokasi anggaran sebesar Rp 9.900,0 miliar (Rp 9,9 triliun). Jumlah relatif sama dengan outlook anggaran 2025 yang sebesar Rp 9.964,7 miliar (Rp 9,96 triliun).

[APBN 2025 Pasal 7](https://peraturan.bpk.go.id/Details/304894/uu-no-62-tahun-2024)
> Anggaran Belanja Negara Tahun Anggaran 2025 direncanakan sebesar Rp3.621.313.743.500.000,00, terdiri atas:
> a. anggaran belanja Pemerintah Pusat; dan
> b. anggaranTKD.

If the parliament budget is calculated as a percentage of the total national treasury, I'd get the value:

(Rp. 9.9 triliun) / (Rp 3,600 triliun) * 100% = 0.275% of the national treasury.

The roleplay starts with a treasury budget of Rp. 3.6 triliun. When calculating the parliament budget based on the percentage, we'd have:

Rp 3.6 triliun * 0.275% = Rp 9.9 miliar

Allocating a budget of IDR 150 B is literally 15 times 9.9 B. Am I missing something? Did I use incorrect data? Did I have a fundamentally flawed reasoning on this?? 

I am begging for any explanation that could help me wrap my head around this situation","",""
