I have started the challenge by simply not taking a sh1t earlier, making it more difficult. Then I thought to myself;
> ""I used to hold my crap for days when I was a child, maybe I still could manage to hold it off for a few days.""

And so I thought, beginning from the evening of Day 2, I have started to face a few minor 'ngeden's as I have ate meal portions as large as your average Caseoh meal. Hope I can survive for the next few days...

Today has been a kind of a normal day to be honest, though the battle between myself and my minor 'urges' has quite been an all-high conflict. I might want to end this experiment/challenge on the later days, possibly on Day 7, nevertheless might still survive. For science!

My 'urges' has now rarely came up today, it only showed up in the evening. I thought this could be more difficult as time goes on, though we shall not underestimate fate, God's rule, and the 'call' of nature —""panggilan alam""— themselves. However, I have been feeling quite a pain on the buttocks after holding it for 5 days, nevertheless it was a small one. I shall continue this challenge to pursue the results of this experiment, for Science!

Now the kick from the days of holding has shown themselves. The pain in the buttocks has increasingly disturbed me today, though not too much. And every time I tried to hold the 'urges' it brings larger and larger pain to my stomach and my butthole. I have decided to set up a vote where you decide my fate in which I have to conclude and finish this experiment/challenge or shall I continue for a few days. Please have mercy...

Just like the previous day, I have felt an enourmous pain in my butthole. And my stomach pain has been increasingly hurting me since. Thankfully, today the butthole, stomach, and holding the 'urges' pains hadn't shown up until afternoon.

And as I checked, the poll deciding my fate has resulted in a win for:
👼 No, this is enough.
***___With a 55% majority vote!___***
First time gratitudely thanking the system of democracy, as you know, usual flawed ones. Thank you, for reading my notes and voting in the poll for the greater good. Might teach me a lesson to never reject ""panggilan alam"". This is my last note, mr. G, out.
