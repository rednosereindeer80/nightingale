Refutation of ""champagne communist/socialist"" comment (an insult that implies a certain degree of hypocrisy against a self-proclaimed socialist, communist, anarchist, and marxist). the sole purpose of this insult is to cause a collective withdrawal of legitimacy away from the individual on the receiving end of it, even if their claim has absolutely no meaningful evidence in support of it.

There has been an alarming amount of ppl here who often conflate Karl Marx's theory on social classes (Proletarian & bourgeoisie) with Max Weber's three level economic class model (upper, middle, lower class). the Weberian stratification of the middle class is not synonymous to the bourgeoisie. on that note, proletarian and bourgeoisie are not terms about how much money ppl make, they are terms defining ones relationship to the means of production. in theory and practice so-called ""rich"" proletarians and ""poor"" bourgeois' exist. It is become clear that the bourgeois stratification of social classes has prevailed and even cloud that of Karl Marx's dialectical analysis, even when the former deeply lacks the profundity of the latter, clinging onto the notion that prestige and power are separate from that of wealth. the misconstrued explanation of all things reign supreme over the truest explanation.","","⚒️ (1),true (2),debating (1)"

As Georgi Plekhanov argued for; ""Marxism doesn't deny the existence of so-called great men, and in fact we should expect that ppl with more material means should have more potential to effect change."" but he also argued that these ppl are produced from and rooted in the socioeconomic environments of their time, and did not divert the overall trend. So the view that Marx strictly argued for historical determinism, or a set universal scheme of development, is purely just a product of post-marx revisionism. as marx has never in his life showed support of this.","",""

Working under the current capitalist mode of production has long been commodified. being overqualified for a job that you're doing and continuing to do under those circumstances that logically should put you at an advantage, is being perceived as a noble trait of the avg proletariat. There can be no valor from being a victim of exploitation. dont confuse this as a perpetuation of Labour Devaluation, but as a calling for ppl out there to hold up a critical magnifying glass on the continued exploitation of the Proletarian. if you really gaf at all abt the working class dont continue to show admiration for the toxic environment that the bourgeois class has bestowed and imposed upon uncountable millions across the globe.

My take is: I concur with Derrida that with the death of communism, we should have the spectre of Marx ""haunting"" us. 

Debate around Marxism should not revolve around which Marxism is true - i.e. debate on theory for the sake of theory. Marx is dead; do not dig his grave.

Marxism should live as a means to criticize phenomena; exposing what is happening around us. We should use Marxism as a mere ""tool"" to ask ""is it injustice?"", ""does it help people or benefit few?"", ""How does it works to help people or how does it benefit few instead?"" It should live on as ghost that ""haunts"" our communities.","",""
