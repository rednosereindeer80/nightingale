And for those of you, including in this server who are interested or at least curious of how political party can be formed in Indonesia. Here's some guide for you:

Basic Guide:
1. Have at least 50 members of Indonesian citizens, aged at least 21 years old with notarial deed
2. Must have at least 30% of your members being women.
3. Notarial deed must contain the following: (AD) Anggaran Dasar, ART (Anggaran Rumah Tangga), along with the management of the political party at a central level.
4. Anggaran Dasar (AD) talks about the basic things of your party: Party's Name Vision & Mission, Principles, Characteristics, Image or Symbol, Objective & Function, Place of Residence (such as HQ or offices), Management, Decision Making System, Political Education,  and Financing.
5. Anggaran Rumah Tangga (ART) refers to the further rules and policies inside your own party. The membership' rights and duty, organizational structure, and other operational rules that are important to include outside of AD.
6. The management of the party must have what we call as ""Kepengurusan"" in politics (which refer to the structure of the organization). This include DPP (Dewan Pimpinan Pusat), DPW (Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah) (at least 60% of it), DPD (Dewan Pimpinan Daerah) (at least 50% of it), and DPC (Dewan Pimpinan Cabang) (at least 25% of it). You can also assigned youth organizations or other ormas under your wing.

Quick Note: You can also make political party out of Ormas (Organisasi Masyarakat). Parties such as Nasdem, PKS, PAN and PBB originated from ormas or at least an ormas figure.","",""

**DPP (Dewan Pimpinan Pusat):**
The main or central level of the party itself. Imagine a government but with its internal cabinet who make the major decision making. That is called DPP for a political party. They are the main guys who resided in the HQ or main offices of the party. DPP consisted of the following for its structure:
- Chairperson/President (Ketua Umum)
- Secretary-General (Sekjen)
- Treasurer (Bendara)
- Advisory Council (Dewan Pembina)
- Ethics & Disciplinary Council (Komite Etika & Disiplin)

**DPW (Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah):**
The ones that operated in provincial level. Usually have to cover at least 60% of the management. They ensure that the policy from the national level of the party can be implemented in provincial level. They can be described to be a bridge between DPP to reach DPD. Thus every DPD is under their duty to be oversee. DPW can be consisted of:
- Regional Chairperson
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Legislative Coordination Team (Basically works with elected officials from the party in the provincial legislative body)
Note: DPW is also responsible for preparing strategies for governorship election.

**DPD (Dewan Pimpinan Daerah):**
The ones that operated in city/district level. They have to cover 50% of the management according to the party's requirement. Under the DPW, they have to implement the policy that had been established by provincial level. Their structure consisted of:
- Chairperson of DPD level
- Secretary
- Treasurer 
- Local Election Strategy Team (Prepares for the preparation and strategy for the election campaign of a candidate for mayorship)

**DPC (Dewan Pimpinan Cabang):**
The ones that operated and represent the party at a district level. Compared to other structures above, they are directly engaging with the grassroots community while responsible for local events and mobilizing voters. Consisted of:
- Chairperson of DPC
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Field Coordinator","",""

Simply put, they are still new, haven't negotiated in dark deals nor holding official positions before for most of the time. Thus if the people are willing to bet themselves into something new, small parties such as Partai Garuda, Partai Nusantara, Partai Buruh, and other parties are worth voting for.","",""

When you meet the requirements (primarily Basic Guide 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) it will be most likely be shut down by the oknums. When they feel like they have enough power they will either bribe you or blackmail you. The proofs are those who spark their ideas outside of the country is more appreciated than the ones in the country, maybe you will say ""But Budiman Sudjatmiko was an activist and became a DPR and a part of PDIP"" well maybe he was accepted because he got the merit and the prowess to became one, and if he got rejected the mass might be angry because he participated and sided with the Pro-Reformers. In today's case almost all of the parties in indonesia are siding with the government now, they have reached the intended goals of uniting the internal powers (Parties, Military and the Government) so the chances of making a political party is a bit smaller than before, i have theory that the parties won't be that welcome with your new existence, but good relations takes time anyways. Overall Great Idea but Here? You need to have a LOT of connections and Money.

I will argue that your arguments actually supports mine. To start off, we need at least 50 members, and that is not just your regular members, but founders which means that they have to be the most competent people you can employ as your first few members. This means you need good connections to begin with. Second is that you have budgets for your party. Every parties needs its own funding, including your party. And the fact that I pointed to AD which also include financing. Financing in this case means that every members need to donate money along with donations from their supporters. The main thing you would do will be donating your money to the party. This is why every members need to be financially well-off at the very least to be able to join a party. This is not only for Indonesia, but basically many parties outside of Indonesia since they got funded not only from the government, but their own members.

Usually for most of the time, the ones that fund the party were the party members themselves. This include the higher staffs of the party. Thus if you holds strategic position, you are most likely going to pay for the political party as ""iuran."" And this is the reason why many businesses are important in funding the parties if their boss, members or even businesses for example, are owned by some political members inside the party. At other times, it is supposed to be the government that paid for your party. For example, one DPR member can gain funds according to the number of votes he gained to be elected as DPR (in the laws, it is Rp108 per one vote). The highest votes for DPR in 2024 is about 528.815 votes, so imagine Rp108 x 528K. Then that is about 57 million rupiah being given to your party per year. More DPR members means more funding to your own party. Sometimes a business that wanted to pay or fund your party can do it with the amount of at least 7.5 billion rupiah with a non party member can give you 1 billion rupiah per year for sponsors or donations. So yeah, practically political parties searched for these fundings to get their parties at least more properly funded, with parties are funded by their own members if they haven't get any sponsors or seats yet in the government. And no, sometimes these political members are not paid, but paying for the party instead since they are financially able while holding important positions inside the party. But some lower staffs can be paid by the party along with the members if the party have such rules and financially well funded.","",""
