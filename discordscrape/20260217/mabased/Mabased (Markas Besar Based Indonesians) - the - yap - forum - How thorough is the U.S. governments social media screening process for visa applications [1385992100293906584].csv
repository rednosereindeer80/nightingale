I heard from my seniors that I need to remove any posts from my social media that might offend the US. I'm worried because some of my friends are constantly posting and reposting news regarding Israel and Palestine, some posted globally, and some posted privately using the friend-only setting (Facebook). Does the US government only check what is open to the public, or can they bypass the restriction? (Can they even see chat history?) I'm just being cautious, as this is my first time applying for a visa.","",""

See, since 2019, the U.S. visa applicants have been required to submit social media identifiers (usernames) for platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Thus it had lasted for about 5 years now. What they can obviously see from your profiles would be:
1. Public posts, comments, profile pictures, public groups, likes, etc.
2. Usernames/handles to identify your accounts.
3. Public group chats or online conversations you've joined in, etc.

For the matter of DMs and chat history, including private chats of yours: they usually don't do it but can happen if they have a very strong legal reason to do so. For example, if you are potentially associated with some radical groups, engaging in hate or promoting violent acts, then you should be worried that they will further investigate your datas for investigation. 

Posting, liking, or resharing news or commentary, even if it is about controversial issues like Palestine–Israel, is not a visa disqualifier. If you or your friend simply promote peaceful advocacy, sharing news articles, or expressing humanitarian concerns, then suffice to say, you should be safe. I will suggest however, to see if your friends promoted groups such as Hamas or even trying to glorify violence in their posts, since it could be worrying if they did.","",""

When you land on the US soil, that’s a different story. USCBP can exercise their discretion to search your phone, meaning  they can check your personal chat, etc. It rarely happens, but if it does happen, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to protect you.","",""
