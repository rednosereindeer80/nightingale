Anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates for a society without hierarchical structures or centralized authority. It seeks to eliminate systems of oppression, such as governments, capitalism, and other forms of institutional control, in favor of voluntary cooperation and mutual aid. The idea is that people can organize themselves and live harmoniously without the need for rulers or enforced laws.

Anarchism comes in many forms, including social anarchism, individualist anarchism, and anarcho-syndicalism, among others, each with unique perspectives on how an anarchist society should function. Historically, anarchists have been involved in various movements for social justice, workers' rights, and anti-colonialism.","",""

shor term solution :
preparing a proper tool for the demonstration such as
-Gas Mask
-Riot shiled
-googles
-balaclava
-wagons
-blunt weapon
-paper maps
and etc.

Long term solution :
- We need to established communication with other parties and have a written treaty with them, and establish a good line of commands with them by doing exercise together and continuous communication with them.
- ready the supplies and mark them in the map so that we can resupply to the designated location.
- and if we can, we can shake them from business sector or banks.( tbh idk how to implement this)","",""
