1. Is it always the case that you should have a lot of capital to join a political entities, such as political party?
2. Is there any chances for someone who never joined students organization, either internally or externally, to become a political cadre in the party? Or is it always a mandatory prerequisite (to enrolled as an organization member) to joining the party?
3. What are the ""mesin partai"" aside from the bohirs/financiers?
4. They said that most of the big parties have a political institute, do they give a significant role in the party?
