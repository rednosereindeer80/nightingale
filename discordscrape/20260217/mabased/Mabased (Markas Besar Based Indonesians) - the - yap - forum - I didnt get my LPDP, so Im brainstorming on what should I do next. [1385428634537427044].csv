* I'll try again during batch 2 of LPDP. I'm convinced I can get it on my second try, since on my first I got a grade (1110) really close to the passing grade (1200) Meanwhile, I'll slowly build my portfolio
  - I'll see if I can work part time as a clinical nutritionist at the boarding school I studied in
  - I'll also overhaul my instagram account with 1k+ followers to post videos on nutrition
  - Maybe to make the next LPDP easier, I'll see if I can get an LoA at a top 30 university
* I might be visiting Melbourne, Australia in a few weeks to look for opportunities on a holiday visa
  - Of course, I can't apply for jobs or whatnot, but I can try to find connections
  - I'll try to e-mail a bunch of professors and see if any of them are interested in funding my research
  - Thinking out of the box, I'll also see if I can find a prospecting employer, maybe in food RnD, or food production QC, that kind of stuff
* I'll apply for professional education in dietetics in Poltekkes, but there's no info on when that's open
* TNI is a last resort. I've got my cousin who's an admiral in AL, but I'm not even sure what I'll be doing there. Maybe I'll work as a corpsman?

Any other ideas? Because you're all more than welcome to contribute","",""
