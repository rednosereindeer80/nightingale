***___Imagine a scenario:___***
### 28th June 1914

> Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife —Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg— were visiting Sarajevo with a command from Emperor Franz Joseph to observe military maneuvers in Bosnia scheduled in June 1914. After their first stop for a brief inspection of a military barracks, the motorcade were to leave the barracks and head to the Sarajevo Town Hall through the street infront of Appel Quay near the Miljacka river by 10:00am, according to the program.
> 
> As the parade of motorcades accompanying both nobles marched through the street, a bomb was thrown by Nedeljko Čabrinović at 10:10am towards the Archduke's motorcade, unfortunately it bounced off and into the street. The bomb detonated under a car behind, wounding 16-20 people. The parade of motorcades quickly moved at high speed, arriving at the Town Hall.
> 
> At 10:45am, both the Archduke and the Duchess got back on their motorcade to visit the wounded people in the previous attack. In order to ensure safety, Governor-General Oskar Potiorek decided that the imperial motorcade should avoid the crowded city centre and ___ successfully told his decisions to the drivers___. Thus, the Archduke's motorcade driver —Leopold Lojka— drove the imperial motorcade straight along the Appel Quay instead of them turning right near the Latin Bridge in our real historical timeline. Hence, the assasination was delayed or even prevented, leading to the postponed or halted upcoming of the Great War (World War One).

Now my question is:
1. What happens next for that time's geopolitical circumstances?
2. How will this alternate ending affect things like colonialism, economy, us as Indonesians, and etc.
3. In this alternate history, will it still lead to the rise of Hitler and World War Two or a different conflict?","",""

If a serb nationalist detonated that (i hadnt read about Cabrinovic), it would still spark tensions between Austria Hungary and Serbia by Austria Hungary's suspicioun on Serbia. It would prob delay the world war","",""
