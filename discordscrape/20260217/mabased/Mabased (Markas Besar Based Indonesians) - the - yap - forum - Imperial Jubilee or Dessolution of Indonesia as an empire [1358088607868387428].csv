This what i cannot comprehend, why so many still attach to the concept of indonesia, despite decades of failures.

The world is changing. We already have a country like Singapore that is running based on realism and pragmatism, rather than whatever messianism that the republikens believes in. If that didnt knock someone on the head, then its their fault.

The only reason that i can think of why people refuse to see any other alternatives outside of the current concept of Indonesia is because the social sciences here is dominated by, at least, the Enlightenment, at most, Marxism.

And the republiken founders, were a believer of the dialectics(?). So perhaps many sees Indonesia as this unstopable embodiment of it and it will be an existensial crisis to go against it.

Because, if it mere about finding the right technique to run things, there is no need for people to be so dogmatic about a failing system. 

You have federalism, culture-based reforms, and what any other ideas that were around prior the republic, but none are willing to look at these, because in the end, they didnt want to go outside the current concept of Indonesia","","This (1)"
