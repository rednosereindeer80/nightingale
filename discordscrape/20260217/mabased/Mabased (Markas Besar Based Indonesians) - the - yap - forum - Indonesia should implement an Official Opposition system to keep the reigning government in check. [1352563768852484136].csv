But our democracy is not a parliamentary, our parliament building is kinda CCP assembly building (therefore that is not suitable to having a debate, psychologically), and our Sila ke-4 oppose the opposition idea, indirectly.

The next question is how to revamp  *big umbrella parliament* system to *at least we have an opposition-ahh parliament*?","",""

1. Does the opposition system require us to have a parliamentary system as a prerequisite?
2. Why do you say that the 4th Sila opposes the opposition idea?","",""

2. Because on Sila 4 is stated that we are running democracy with ""Musyawarah Mufakat"". Also if we are reading the *official translation* of that, we are allowed to having a opposition ONLY if we have a *good-helpful criticism* (something that always has been indoctrinate since ORBA). To make it worse, those *official translation* are derived from the ORBA itself (P4).","",""

1. The price to running the decent party is astronomical
2. if we have an ideology-based party (either right or left, liberals or conservative or religion based), they must comply to Pancasila as *Asas Tunggal* on their AD/ART.
3. Our bureaucracy is crippling (corrupt law-maker and law-enforcement)","",""
