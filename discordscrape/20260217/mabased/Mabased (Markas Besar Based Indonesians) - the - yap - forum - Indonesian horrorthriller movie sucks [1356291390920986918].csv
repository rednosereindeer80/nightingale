They always use the Java culture, black magic and Muslim as their elements. 

Besides that, I think most director of Indonesian horror movie only depends on the jumpscare, I think most of them don't understand how to make horror movie without depending on jump scare and the same elements (Java culture, muslim, black magic). 

Horror movie shouldn't be dependent only with shock factor, they should be making the audience feel disturbed, uncomfortable, stress etc. That's why most people love horror movie because of that feeling.","","👍 (5)"
