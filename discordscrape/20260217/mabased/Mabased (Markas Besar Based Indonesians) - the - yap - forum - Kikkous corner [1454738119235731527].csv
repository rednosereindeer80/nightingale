So I thought why don't I do something light and fun for the server~
Little pick-me-up from your yours truly (who)

Drop your questions below and I’ll pull a card or two for you! 

# What this is

- Just-for-fun tarot readings, I'm no seer or omnipotent cenayang, please don't rely on this reading too much for the future 😭💀
- Guidance & reflection only — not fate, not prophecy
Please don’t put too much hope or get too hung up on what I say here, pleasee :crythumbsup: :sniff: 
- Take what resonates, leave the rest if you don't feel like it, also I can be really biased so do filter my messages please :crying:

# How the reading works
- 1–2 questions per person (add sub questions if you wanna, 3 max)
- 1–3 cards per question (depending on the vibe / if I’m intrigued 👀)
Interpretations will be under ~2000 characters, not super long or ultra-detailed
- First come, first served basis — I’ll go one by one, so please have some patience :kitty: 

Example questions you can ask:
“What should I focus on going into the new year?”
""How's my love life looking forward?”
“What am I overlooking about *insert situation* ?”
“What should I improve about myself t9 welcome the new year?”
“How can I take better care of myself emotionally?” (Tho please get a therapist if you can afford it :crying: ) 

Or you can ask Political stuff just for fun, tho ehhhh, not really my thing to do 🤷","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1454738119235731527/1454738119642447882/5e40d25db390ccf27df6cfb318bbd5e95b6f81bec2846e8cce0fa254493d2fd3_720x.jpg?ex=69961333&is=6994c1b3&hm=81fc82b3fb322fd2b287f6a3ad366483128b8b9febe9ac67aff164f2e0cb637e&","wpointing (3)"

I’d rather handle it in one go so others don’t wait too long and the flow stays smooth 🙈

If you don’t feel comfy asking here, or prefer a private interpretation, feel free to request it or DM me~

Hard boundaries (please read)
🚫 No health, legal, or death-related questions
🚫 No dark questions like “When will A die” — shoo shoo negative energy :catgun: 
🚫 If you’re here to preach religion in the thread, I won’t entertain it. Please get your own thread. :catgun:

One last thing
Please bear with me — I take my time when writing interpretations, because I like to sit with the cards a bit 🕯️
(and I have stuff to do too irl, do remind me tho if I procrastinate too lomg HAHAHAH)

Alright… drop your questions ~

The Hermit, in Reverse

Don't get offended okay, but you might have isolate yourself for too long, and even if not, you don't quite have giving yourself the intimacy you wanted because you are too afraid of wasting your energy on somethings that aren't guaranteed

So instead of risking it, you pull back, and that keeps you lonely even when you don’t want to be.

Then
Seven of Pentacles Reversed

You might have been impatient, and then choose to dismiss the efforts altogether.

You want smth instant, anything that doesn't fit your ideal gets dismissed immediately

So try to wait a bit more and don't give in to your impulses

Then at the end
You got Ace of Wands

The card basically tells you to get a move, new chapter, new arc, something entirely new, something real motion and movement

The card is basically telling you to move, to actually start something instead of waiting for certainty. Or something in the past.

Get yourself together, allow yourself to feel properly, don't get stuck in what if and preconceptions, a new clean slate and let thing grow properly, and be there, actually, and live in it

So your cards is

# Two of wands, reversed

This card means stuck between two option, and here it can feel like whether or not you'll make a right choice moving forward.

So there's gonna be a period where you'll feel stuck because you want to see other chances or other aspect you can reach or explore

# Ten of Cups, Reversed

Usually this cards means emotional fulfillment, but reversed it meant emotional dissatisfaction

""This supposedly make me feel great, why doesn't it?""

Maybe you starting to feel imbalance in effort and what it came to fruition

This can happen especially when you get rewarded by something, an achievement, but you feel rather hollow about it

# The Empress, reverse 

Again this card upright usually means good things in upright —nurturement, growth, abundance of new things— but reversed, it's over giving, being depleted and have nothing more to give, neglecting yourself, blocked compassion 

So it can means you're losing passion in teaching, or the joy of it, maybe because of being underappreciated or undervalued

Have creative stagnation (like art block in artists), basically you're draining yourself out

You do have lots lf progress, sure

But it came with a price of depleting yourself and it can lead to burning yourself out (implied, but it's less ""it will definitely happen"", the cards is more warning you rn) 


TLDR
You'll want to see 2026 as reorientation year, setting more course, Setting more boundaries and limit yourself so you don't.... ""Lebih besar pasak daripada tiang"" yourself

Also separate advice, try separating yourself from your profession and what you do

YOU'RE DOING GREAAAAAT","","👍 (1)"

Your reputation isn’t in danger per se, but trying to force it to improve now could backfire, think of it like planting seeds, rather than showing off blooms before they’re ready, and making yourself under pressure even more

You don't need other competition or other arguments, what you need right now is channel your energy properly in places that actually deserve your attention and yield better results","","👍 (1)"

Overall? Upright it meant being stuck and being in danger and helpless in it

But yours is reversed, so this means that ***you're liberated, cathartic, like a burden just been let go***

From what exactly? 

Got clarifier,

# Three of Swords, Reversed

The universal break up card in upright, in Reverse it meant that you've healed from wound from past heartbreak and ready to move on, you've learnt your lesson and ready to face what's actually going on again

Then another clarifier
# Five of cups, also reversed

You've moved on from regrets and losses, basically no more looking back and you left feeling like a huge burden finally put down where it should've been placed, and it doesn't drag you anymore

Try to stay focused in what you have and not what have lost, especially what could've been.

You have new hope coming in~

So, it's
# The Tower

Disastrous, sudden change or upheaval, unexpected change

It'll be a fruitful challenge yes, especially in terms of handling loss of control, so don't feel too low about this

It's not doomed —your project—, necessarily, it just means there something that doesn't quite fit in your framework of thinking. 

Clarifier for this is The world in reverse and eight of Pentacles in reverse

You didn't see the end result or it's nkt necessary going to where you are trying to steer it into, right now that is, which is why you might have question this in the first place 

I do think you're doing this in idealistic ways, or too stuck on what you envision the fruit of the labor would be

You're overthinking ways or attaching the process to ideals or perfection way too much right now

So TLDR

It’s less about “nailing it” immediately and more about learning how to handle unpredictability. 

Success will come, but it won’t be in the form you might expect. The “aha, I nailed it!” moment may ONLY arrive after the shake-up, after you take back the steering wheel","",""

Six of Swords,  you have to stay if it feels safer, more stable, and less draining.

Overall it won't excite you staying, but it's not stagnation, just you slowing down and trying to settle for once
  
# Attend uni again  
  
Hierophant and Ace of wands  

If you feel like it you should, you have something that just clicks in with going back to uni right now, and this also apa ya, renew your spark and strengthen your framework even better

But do try minding the earlier advice, you might havr to support someone or some people financially and this might disrupt it if you choose this path

But overall, this choice should be what you pick in general especially because it's what benefits and speaks more beneficial towards yourself 
  
# Jumping through companies again   
  
The world in reverse , nope, no, don't. You'll never feel fulfilled, anf this in general means you're always resetting and it can lead to a path that doesn't really fulfill you in the future, it leaves you stagnated if navigated roughly

Hmmmm, something might happen early in the year, and yes you have to go through it and navigate through it carefully, be careful of losing agency or boundaries

# Six of pentacles

There's a balancing phase that comes after, making things even, paying back debts or surplus in general.

With it financial balance and a more stable and less up and downs of financial situations

Lastly
# Five of Pentacles in reverse

Basically more help, more hands and back you can rely on, you don't have to burden yourself with everything and anything all at once again and you've gone through the worst part (possibly referring to Ace of Sword)

Girlie you sure you're not just being a bystander only right now? But yea overall, methinks it's best if you start from loving and starting fundamentally from yourself

Don't worry though, you do get
# Two of Cups after

So you do get some chance at a beginning, steady too even, in some months after

Though be careful of getting infatuated too quickly or rush on handling things","","noted (1),rose (1)"

In serene depths, this question I mull and know.

Just as creatures in placid waters dwell,
Do they ponder their own reflection's spell?

In the gentle current, I seek sanctuary's grace,
A mirror to the heavens, where truths embrace.

Am I the tranquil water or the life within its keep?
In silence, secrets stir, where dreams sleep.

Yet, do those below grasp their mirrored sight,
In the glassy sheen, do they find their light?

Entwined in the water's gentle embrace,
In stillness, echoes of self find their place.

So, let me be the water, and the life it cradles,
In harmony and rhythm, our essence unravels.

For within this calm, our souls intertwine,
Reflecting truths in nature's sacred design.

They say we should be like flowing river, forward, everlong.
Yet I find solace in being calm, not strong.

Reflective and steadfast, I wish to stand my ground,
In the stillness, my truths can be found.

-----

I wonder: am I the water or the creatures below?
In this calm water, can they see themselves, I don't know.

In the gentle end of streams, I find my quiet retreat,
Away from screams, fleeting away from the concrete

Away from that rigid mold,

_but even then I found no solace or peace_

Away from the harsh conditions that erode the hardest rocks,

_still, I long for something more than just an unmoving calm... I'm such a paradox._

Again I question my own lustrous foretold

Am I the water's calm or the boisterous life it holds?","",""

Do the creatures below see their own reflection?
In the calm, do they find introspection?

||(supposedly the writer notice that they don't live in complete solitude and have someone else here but old me didn't continue the notion)||

Like them, I'm part of this tranquil scene,
In stillness, I find where my thoughts convene.

In the deep calm waters, where silence reigns,
I find myself longing for someone who shares my plains.
Though muted they may be, the solitude is harsh,
I yearn for someone who can navigate the depths, not just a farce.

Amidst this tranquil expanse, I seek a kindred soul,
To understand the mysteries, to make me whole.
For in the depths, where loneliness resides,
I crave companionship that silently abides.

From top-left to down-right

- Motoko Kusanagi — Ghost in The Shell
- Darth Revan — Star Wars
- Dazai Osamu — Bungou Stray Dogs
- Asuka Shikinami Langley — Evangelion Rebuild Movies
- Chilchuck Tims — Dungeon Meshi
- Kishibe Rohan — JJBA
- Lain — Serial Experiment Lain
- Lacus Clyne — Gundam Seed

I'm not really familiar with any of the character, outside Dazai (oh and it's specifically Port Mafia Dazai for some reason, LMAOOO)

I found this one, the 2024/2025 one particularly intriguing because I've surface research each of and and they're each doesn't really fit within some, namely Lacus being the character I am most confused about, though after I watched some clips I can see why the person gave me Lacus (even though she's... Ehh, just not my usual vibed character) 

I found this to be a good insight on how people see me in general hehe :smile: 

The characters I don't include are Maomao, Frieren, Angel Devil (?), and Shouko Ieiri

- **Name**: Ethelrik Nikolai 'Niko' Douglas
- **Age**: Late 20s
- **Personality**: Lawful Neutral
- **Faction**: Economic Renewal Bloc (ERB) 🟦
- **Position / Role**: Administrative Liaison / Procedural Operator

***Political Profile***

**Public Persona:**

-# *The following profile is adapted from a paid media feature commissioned by interests compiled from past and recent interviews*

“Reserved, analytical, and procedural-minded.    
Ethelrik Nikolai Douglas, familiarly called by Niko, comes from the well-known **Douglas** family, though he is notably more inward-facing and restrained compared to his sanguine, overtly oligarchic relatives.

He is widely perceived as institutional rather than ideological.

While formally associated with the ERB, his presence is administrative and non-expressive, maintaining a deliberately non-committal posture.

Often described as cautious, dull, or difficult to read. He dislikes emotional grandstanding and public confrontation, but is not passive when institutional continuity or public order is at risk.”

**True Ambition:**
*Survival ≥ Recognition*  
Seeks to remain relevant enough to survive political instability, and to survive long enough to matter. While survival is his explicit priority, recognition functions as a secondary drive.

**Ideology (Public / Private):**  
*Public* : Institutional Stability, Public Order, leaning Central-Right 
*Private* : Pragmatic authoritarianism, highly meritorious. Believes systems are inherently flawed but necessary.","",""

||Sleep under thousands of lights.
For there is your stay.

Away from me in sight.
Darkest nights is where i lay.

In the glow of starlight's dance,
Where dreams take flight, in endless trance.
Where exist silent whispers in the breeze,
Carry hopes, where heart finds ease.

Underneath the moon's soft gaze,
In solitude, the mind can craze.
But amidst the shadows deep,
A glimmer of hope, it starts to seep.

Through the darkness, a path appears,
Guiding through doubts, calming fears.
Each step taken, towards the light,
Finds solace in the darkest night.

Realizing in the darkest nights,
Is where stars glows for thousands and the brightest.

We are in each others sight.||","",""

People of the **social** variant prefer to be in groups or teams. They are more interested than the other subtypes in the position that they and others have in a group, and are consequently concerned with status. Wanting to be accepted, they try to fit in and be nice.

People of the **self-preservation** variant are generally trying to be comfortable and independent. Their well-being is very important to them, so they pay much attention to their health, house and financial position. They are less interested in interpersonal contact, and are typically less spontaneous and don't show as much emotion as people of the other two subtypes of their enneagram type.

People of the **sexual** variant are very much interested in one to one contacts. They are looking for intimacy and this may show in sexuality, though not necessarily. Being in a relationship is very important to them. They are the most passionate of the subtypes, being temperamental and having more energy. They have less of a problem with getting into a fight and care less about rules and responsibility.","",""

The instinctual subtype is what you get when you narrow down your enneagram type combined with one of the three instincts (SP, SO, or SX). One of those instincts is dominant and so it creates a variant of your enneagram type. For example, the SP 1, SO 1 and SX 1 all focus their need to be perfect on different aspects of life and go about it in different ways. The three instincts are used in a stacking order, i.e. one is dominant, one is used less so, and one is a blindspot. These stackings are written as such with the blindspot not listed: SO/SP, SO/SX, SO/SP, SO/SX, SX/SP, and SX/SO. So for example, a SX/SP 6 is a 6 who leads with the Sexual instinct, follows with the Self-Preservation instinct, and ignores the Social instinct. Depending on what subtype you are, it can vary the general flavour of your type quite a lot.","",""

This type appears One-like also, but for different reasons. This time, the social instinct combines with the self-pres to give this subtype a strong desire to know where they fit within the group, with whom they can make strong alliances. Conversely, they can counterphobicaly oppose groups. They are usually political in some form. Adhering to rules is seen as very important to this type. They have issues with authority, such as distrusting reactively or trusting too vehemently. This is the result of their lack of a close connection to people (a function of the undeveloped sexual instinct). Their allegiance is not to individuals but to a group of like-minded others. This subtype could possibly find themselves in jobs such as with the police of firefighting force, and in such professions where it is possible to identify with a group which has clearly defined rules and purposes. On the up side, these are people with a strong moral compass; they can be counted on to do the right thing. They do volunteer work. They become politicians. They are generally solid people. On the down side, their “us against them” thinking can turn into bigotry, paranoia, and “playing the martyr.”

In relationships, they can appear almost Two-like sometimes. Their need for people in their lives, coupled with the sexual instinct being last, causes them to worry about the close bonds they have with others and can also cause them to “go towards” while at the same time requiring validation about the strength of the bond. On the down side, they can become very critical of others when they fear their differences. Their need to find security within the group is threatened when others don’t do things the way they do or think the way they think. This occurs mostly when this subtype is unhealthy. When they are healthier, the differences between themselves and others are not bothersome and may even be seen as reassuring.","",""

• most industrious 6, eager/responsible, always busy, mistaken for 3, fear is managed by achieving, feel the burden of obligation, focus on duty/family. A 6 with a strong superego. Lots of issues regarding personal competency. At lower health, the most likely of the 6s to respond negatively and reactively to pressure from others, since there is already a nearly unbearable pressure from within. Type 6 is security-oriented, and can alternate between serious doubt and serious loyalty. They tend to be pretty rule-focused right off the bat (as they are a superego type) but then add 1 onto the mix and, like that tri-type description gives you, they can get fixated on constructing appropriate rules. Type 1 is usually critical of themselves and others, which is the component that enables a Type 6 to channel their desire for a workable rule set into the desire to create a workable rule set. Type 3, the image type in this triad, likes to be seen as successful and effective. Adding 6, 1 and 3 together would create a personality type that's dedicated toward seeking out the best rule set.

Jadilah belukar, tetapi belukar yang baik,
Yang tumbuh di tepi danau

Kalau kamu tak sanggup menjadi belukar,
Jadilah saja rumput, tetapi rumput yang
Memperkuat tanggul pinggiran jalan

Kalau engkau tak mampu menjadi jalan raya
Jadilah saja jalan kecil,
Tetapi jalan setapak yang
Membawa orang ke mata air

Tidaklah semua menjadi kapten

Bukan besar kecilnya tugas yang menjadikan tinggi
Rendahnya nilai dirimu

Se dominants seek a sense of __engagement__, pleasure, or excitement, therefore, they are naturally attuned to new opportunities for firsthand experiences that seem fun, intriguing, or exciting to them. Being spontaneous and quick to respond to change allows them to adapt fluidly and learn fast on the fly, easily putting negativity behind them to move on to new vistas. However, this also means that they may not take enough time to reflect on whether the experiences they pursue are meaningful for their long term development, perhaps becoming too rash or haphazard when decision making. When a person does not know how to use Se appropriately, they tend to develop an avoidant mindset because immediate escape is the easier path to take when faced with harsh difficulties or negative consequences. Healthy Se dominants tend to be good at taking advantage of shifting conditions and enjoy operating at peak “in the zone” mental and/or physical performance, often admired for their realness, resilience, or natural ease.","",""

When dominant behaviors lead to unavoidable negative consequences, unconscious inferior Ni impulses start to rise up and overwhelm Se’s easygoing adaptability. When in Ni grip, Se dominants are likely to become gloomy, cynical, or disconnected, e.g.: they may find it difficult to enjoy the things that usually engage their attention; they may become paranoid and only see the doomed scenario of every situation; they may feel as though the world has nothing to live for and then search desperately for some kind of “spiritual meaning”. Generally speaking, they are too restless to intricately synthesize contradictory perspectives into an accurate vision of the future like the best Ni dominants, therefore, their unconscious attempts to use Ni to compensate for Se extremes do not tend to turn out well, especially when under stress (due to poorly developed judging functions that lead to bad decision making). 

Ni expresses the need for reflection, direction, purpose, and vision. Therefore, ignoring Ni for too long often results in recklessness, aimlessness, meaningless lifestyle, and unfulfilled potential. To determine whether you experience inferior Ni grip, ask yourself what uncharacteristic impulses rise up when you “lose yourself” and become the worst version of you. A grip state can take the form of a temporary and maladaptive reaction to short-term environmental stress, however, there are also more chronic grip cases that result from long term personality development problems (these individuals generally misuse all four functions and have poor self-knowledge of the dominant function.)","",""
