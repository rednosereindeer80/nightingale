This is not an endorsement of any particular system or action, but rather a creative exploration of what an “extreme” approach might look like in a chaotic, hypothetical scenario.

#Garuda Membara

1.Foundational Mythos

The Archipelago Phoenix
Indonesia, metaphorically a phoenix, must repeatedly “burn away the old” to spark new beginnings. In Garuda Membara, constant upheaval is viewed not as tragedy but as a generative force that purifies corruption and stagnation. Chaos is not merely tolerated but harnessed as an engine for transformation.

Disruptive National Unity
Different regions, ethnicities, religions, and traditions are to be aggressively unified under one banner, any sign of “division” is swiftly neutralized. “Bhinneka Tunggal Paksa” Diversity is “welcome,” but only if it serves the overarching goal of the state’s singular vision.

Supremacy of the Collective Will
Individual freedoms exist only insofar as they strengthen the collective might of the archipelago. Extreme discipline and sacrifice are demanded from citizens, anything less is deemed disloyal. A paramilitary culture permeates daily life, with mandatory training and public demonstrations to ensure that every citizen is “battle-ready” to defend the ideology.","",""

Ritualized Chaos
Ceremonial Upheaval.Periodically orchestrated “Statewide Purges” of outdated institutions, considered necessary to regenerate the nation’s spirit. Government ministries, media outlets, or businesses deemed “inefficient” are systematically dismantled and replaced. The public is encouraged to “celebrate” these upheavals as sacred rites that keep the national spirit vigilant and dynamic.

Single, Unyielding Vanguard
The should be made a “Garuda Council” which is a powerful, unelected council of “national guardians” (military leaders, ideologues, and select technocrats) who hold absolute authority over legislative and executive functions. and thus there exists an Eternal Leadership which Leaders remain until they either die or are overthrown by rival council members. A coup is seen as legitimate if it can prove it brings about “pure regeneration.”

Controlled Dissent
There must be a State-Run Contrarian Groups, Rather than banning opposition outright, the regime creates and sponsors its own “rebel” factions to maintain an atmosphere of constant tension. “Dissenters” who aren’t part of the official contrarian network face severe penalties, often disappearances or forced re-education.

Great Leap of the Archipelago
A fanatical push for rapid industrial and infrastructural growth, even if it means mass displacement or environmental devastation. The archipelago is viewed as a single workshop for forging national “greatness”; entire forests can be leveled or islands restructured in the name of progress.

Isolation with Strategic Exploits
While maintaining an extremely insular society, Garuda Membara seeks resource-based alliances abroad—exchanging minerals, oil, or maritime routes for advanced weapons, technology, or political leverage. International diplomacy is characterized by assertive shows of strength, cyber sabotage, and willingness to exploit global tensions for Indonesia’s gain.","",""

Mass Mobilization & Surveillance
“Every Citizen a Watcher” A sweeping program where neighborhood councils act as an extension of the state intelligence apparatus. Encourages public vigilance bordering on paranoia to root out “traitors.” because most Indonesian nowdays LOVE to record and upload it to social media. And thus be made a Hyperlocal Courts an instant tribunals that can pass judgment in the name of “national regeneration,” leading to swift punishments.

Mandatory “State Devotion” Service. All Indonesians between 15 and 35 must serve at least five years in government-directed enterprises, be it industrial projects, farmland clearing, or paramilitary training. Rewards include elevated social status, preferential treatment in housing, and access to “elite rations.” Noncompliance results in exile or forced labor.

Chaotic Cultural Fusion
The regime forcibly combines traditional arts (wayang, gamelan, dangdut) with modern, often jarring, entertainment forms to craft “High Chaos Culture” events. The stated goal is to shock the populace out of complacency, to ensure a continuous sense of collective adrenaline that drives them toward unity.

Nusantara Reforged Education
Schools practice indoctrination from early childhood, teaching the “Nusantara Reforged” curriculum, where the archipelago’s history is recast as a cycle of glorious collapses and rebirths.
Science and technology are valued only insofar as they serve the state’s industrial and militaristic goals, with arts education focusing on agitprop and martial symbolism.

Resource Extraction & Forced Relocation
Under a policy named “Bara Kalkulasi” entire towns can be relocated to exploit strategic resources. Environmental preservation is secondary to the state’s ambition. Ritual planting ceremonies after large-scale deforestation exist mainly as propaganda events.","",""

Potential Outcome.

1. Short-Term Gains, rapid infrastructure development, a fear driven but disciplined population, and a semblance of “unity” under iron-fisted rule (Tangan Besi)

2. Long-Term Instability. As forced compliance foments underground resistance and generational trauma, the ideology itself fuels further chaos, leading to inevitable internal factionalism and cyclical power grabs.","",""

Garuda: ofc the signifying power, sovereignty, and national pride.

Membara represents the fiery passion, unrest, and perpetual purging that forms the bedrock of this extremist ideology.

Chaos. Now instead of running from Indonesia’s complexities and occasional instability, the movement doubles down, weaponizing discord for the sake of “constant renewal.”","",""

Disclaimer
“Garuda Membara” should not be interpreted as an endorsement or call to real-world action. It is an imaginative exploration of an extreme political model that harnesses chaos and authoritarian tactics in the Indonesian context. In reality, such a system would likely be disastrous for human rights, civil liberties, and long-term societal harmony.","",""
