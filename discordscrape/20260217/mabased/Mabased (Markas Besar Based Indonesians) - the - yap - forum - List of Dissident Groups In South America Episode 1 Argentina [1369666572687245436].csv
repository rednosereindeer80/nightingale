Prologue & Context: In 1955, Juan Domingo Perón was overthrown from his position as the dictator of Argentina caused massive backlash from some of the Argentinian populace. Those who stayed loyal with Peron and his ideas eventually known as the Peronist faction. The Peronist faction claimed for the return of Peron from the exile along with list of policies that Peron had implemented during his rule. Eventually, the Peronist was splitted into two factions: the right and left. The crisis of dissident groups in Argentina only sparked furthermore with the formation of other groups, including those that followed or supported Guevarist theories. It was only after Peron return along with the legalization of Peronist faction, where the instability managed to stop. Decades later, another few dissident groups took part in the early 2000's chaos in Argentina, where by 2010 to 2013, a list of anarchist groups caused arsons and explosive attacks in multiple areas.

Brief Description: A far right, orthodox Peronist and fascist movement that exist in Argentina. Exist during late 1950's to late 1960's, they were formed out of loyalty to Peron against the current democratic government that had advocate for non-religious program in 1957. The Tacuara movement become a major opposition, reaching its strongest by 1960 to 1962. Its downfall mainly came when the group started to be outlawed, with their leaders either died, deserted, resigned, or simply unable to lead anymore. The movement was founded by Alberto Ezcurra Uriburu, José Joe Baxter, Óscar Denovi and Eduardo Rosa, in which the four of them separated with their own paths. Some of their members even joined the police to squash or become a part of the resistance against the revolutionary lefts, including the Peronist leftist groups.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369666745891029042/image.png?ex=699666cf&is=6995154f&hm=a8ef59681edaa9cdb9cff53a7308045792450d14726f28b242f19875831b7125&",""

1. Urban Paramilitary Tactics
Tacuara operated in urban environments, especially in Buenos Aires. Their “combat style” was not about jungle warfare or rural insurgency but was grounded in urban paramilitary actions, mainly due to their founding being in Buenos Aires. There are few recorded and documented tactics being implemented by the movement:
- Street brawls: Often clashing with leftist groups, unions, and Jewish students. These were organized attacks using clubs, knives, and sometimes firearms later on. Street ambushes are the most relied tactic done by the Tacuara. Often times, they moved in small, tight cells (consisted of 5–10 members) when patrolling, regrouping or moving inside a location. They practiced a kind of street discipline resembling early Blackshirts or Falangist brigades, as they move in unison while wearing uniforms that symbolized intimidation & militarized presence. Their cells can be described to heavily decentralized, which in multiple accounts, leading to violent attacks or actions done out of the cell’s initiative rather than by a central command.
- Sabotage: Mainly vandalism on the streets or areas as they were against symbols of communism, liberalism, or Judaism. This includes graffiti, destruction of property, and attacks on synagogues or leftist bookstores. They often defaced or attacked buildings symbolizing “Judeo-Marxism” (by their own term), including press offices, bookstores, and schools.
- Bombings: During the group's later phase, a few splinter factions engaged in low-scale bombings, often homemade devices planted at political or religious sites.","",""

The robbery was done with the members are armed with small arms as the police later identified the perpetrator being a Tacuara member. Acts of terrorism were done through bombings in a few cases, with kidnapping along with torturing individuals happened in a few occasions (most famously the Graciela Sirota case in 1962). These terror tactics were specifically aimed to the Jewish communities as part of their anti-semitic agenda. Recruits and new members were encouraged in participating in the act as part of the ritualistic action inside the group for strengthening bond in violence. It took a public backlash in the media for the government to finally outlawed the movement’s action and existence, along with the police crackdown which caused their decline by late 1960’s.","",""

Tacuara is considered the first urban guerilla group of Argentina, and for a good reason. Their street tactics are known to be fast, chaotic and well designed to avoid arrest. In a few riots, they were known to be smaller yet able to provoke larger groups of the lefts to get into fighting. Bladed weapons, iron bar, or some small firearms are used by various groups in order to enact hit-and-run tactic. In some cases, once they confront leftist mobs or groups during protest, marches or gathering, they intentionally provoked them to clash then doing rapid retreat, which then invited police crackdown on mostly leftist groups. Hit-and-run tactic become their common moves in targeting leftist figures or groups, sending a political message while avoiding any prolonged fights. Some elements began to gather their own firearms once they’ve worked with a few Nazi bureaucrats in Argentina, which turning them from street thugs into an armed militia. Racketeering is included in their street thuggery, in which they demand a so called “revolutionary tax” from many Jewish shops in Bueno Aires.
3. Connections
The main strength from the movement to operate their actions also came from the fact that they’ve attained important connections inside or outside Argentina. Inside of Argentina, they got a few relations with the police and bureaucrats, with huge support from the youth, especially Catholic youth which gathered clerical support too. A few politicians are also reportedly was a part of the movement or at least collaborated with them. Outside of Argentina, they’ve got some supports, most notably: the Arab League in which the representative of Argentina, Hussein Triki had been a Nazi collaborator to the movement.","",""

Brief Description: One of the lesser known yet symbolically still an important dissident groups in Argentina. Associated with the Peronist right-wing activism, they were formed in the mid-1950’s, after the deposal of Juan Peron. They mainly served more as a defensive militia, protecting Peronist gatherings while assisting in their political actions, including underground activities and confronting some anti-Peronist elements. Their founders were not clear, but it was suspected that their formation can be inspired by CGT (Confederacion General del Trabajo) as early Peronist resistance. Catholic nationalists and Peronist caudillos can be regarded to found these groups in the form of decentralized cells. There has never been a formal date on when did the movement disbanded, but it can only be highly suspected that the ideological divergence and absorption of the Peronist factions caused the MNJ to be heavily irrelevant, further added with Peron return in 1973 with the legalization of Peronism.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369667108182425701/image.png?ex=69966725&is=699515a5&hm=bf878c470179265b4efdae37e9a6ceda2f302e7934bd469444db8b4c17af7122&",""

1. Defensive Paramilitarism
The MNJ never really engaged aggressively as their main purpose was mainly protecting the Peronist supporters and groups from dangers. Combat was often reactive, rooted in confrontation with security forces and anti-Peronist mobs, rather than offensive insurgency. For an obvious reason, the MNJ were often outnumbered and outgunned which never really put them into a high confidence in fighting against larger groups. Their defensive concept gave them these tactics:
- Street Brawls: Mainly than confronting the groups head on, there are some noted tactics such as blockade and small-scale sabotage in buildings or streets. Their main armaments are often being blunt weapons, stones or Molotov cocktails. These tactics marked the proto-form of street warfare done by these groups. They sometimes blurred the lines between activists and militia since they attend the march and gathering of Peronist movement yet also engaged in multiple street skirmishes. 
- Secrecy After Failed Coup: After the failed 1956 military uprising by Peronist sympathizer General Juan José Valle, the MNJ and related networks offered support and shelter to dissident soldiers and civilians. They engaged in low-scale urban sabotage and propaganda efforts to keep Peronism alive underground. This marked a turn toward semi-clandestine operations, which include use of safe houses, coded communications, and arms caches.","",""

To start off, the MNJ is never really a centralized group as they are split between many local groups whom were run by their own set of leaders. They have a very decentralized form of a cell-based groups running around the streets in Bueno Aires. This structure mimicked guerrilla cells, but without the long-term training or rural bases typical of later insurgent movements. As a result, they were pretty disorganized with rarely a case that they can pose a bigger threat to a larger force. These cells mainly consisted of young workers, labor activists, former police or military loyal to Perón, combined with some religious-nationalist militants.

Brief Description: One of the earliest resistance movements from Peronist factions, specifically being left-wing guerilla groups in Argentina. Though short-lived, the movement formed the split of the Peronist factions from its right-wing and left-wing aspect. Founded by Envar Cacho El Kadri, they believed that true Peronism could not exist without Juan Perón and that a revolutionary war was necessary to achieve social justice, economic independence, and political sovereignty. Inspired by the Cuban and Algerian revolutions, the FAP advocated for both urban and rural guerrilla tactics. On September 17, 1968, the FAP attempted to establish a guerrilla base in Taco Ralo, yet failed after discovered by the polices. The group engaged in Dirty War, an event that lasted from 1974 to 1983 where the junta military fought against the guerilla groups, including the FAP. Nevertheless, the group grown quite well in the late 1960’s until the early 1970’s where internal division destroyed the group’s unity, as in 1976, the FAP finally had gradually disbanded from heavy repression.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369667354308513873/image.png?ex=69966760&is=699515e0&hm=51b5cef21fb195c36e2e5bb82b9359249262eaf3eae902060e7f419dad2666f2&",""

1. Rural Guerrilla Warfare
The FAP managed to gather supports from the rural areas, which had become their early strong point during the guerilla warfare. During the Taco Ralo attempt in 1968 to 1969, they build encampment in remote terrain with basic military drills, reconnaissance, and early-stage ideological training. Possibly amongst other factions, the FAP managed to be the first few ones that implemented rural guerilla tactics in the political landscape of Argentina. Their tactic relied on Guevara’s method, which is foco. A guerrilla foco is a small cadre of revolutionaries operating in a nation's countryside. This group mainly relied on gathering support not through urban areas, but by rural areas. Though failed at their early attempts, their action gained entry into the next phase of their guerilla warfare.
2. Urban Guerilla Warfare
Once in the cities, FAP developed a low-intensity but high-impact operational style from 1969 to 1970. They conducted multiple tactics and combat styles that are well-noted to be discussed in-depth:
- Robberies & Terrorism: The FAP engaged in multiple attempts to robbing banks along with terrorizing the urban areas. Mainly they targeted foreign companies like US or French companies, including foreign banks too. In some cases, they bombed French or US businesses in order to emphasize their anti-imperialist agenda. These attacks are not just for the sake of robbing or terrorizing the businesses, yet in order to gain media coverage in which their acts can be an emphasis to gain support from the local populace. It is noted that they usually attack in hit and run tactics in order to cause enough destruction then avoid government reinforcements from reaching them on time. Urban ambushes that required stolen vehicles and members disguising themselves were reported in their operations.","",""

Weapons caches, hideouts, and safe houses arranged via trusted union/peronist networks. They had hidden it well for quite a while before being before the split in early 1970’s, with further crackdown on their hideouts by 1976 under the Argentinian dictatorship.
- Planned Attacks on Authority: The FAP were capable enough during its time to enact ambush attacks on the police stations and military posts. Throughout a whole year since 1969, the group was reportedly making attacks towards these areas, possibly stealing weapons and making a symbolic move of emphasizing their agendas on challenging the current Argentinian authority. Homemade explosives, Molotov cocktails, and some military firearms were reportedly used when fighting against the bigger threat such as armed polices or military patrols. 

3.  Political Assassination: The FAP conducted a few infamous assassinations on figures, mainly by a faction inside FAP called “FAP National Command” who claimed responsible for killing SMATA leader, Dirk Kloosterman and construction union leader Marcelino Mansilla in 1973. However, these assassinations were condemned by FAP founder himself, Envar El Kadri which then formed his own faction, splitting from FAP.","",""

From the split, the FAP was further broke down into three factions: 
- Alternativa Independiente (AI): Led by Raimundo Villaflor and Jorge Caffatti, this faction emphasized independent working-class struggle, distancing itself from traditional Peronist structures. They are the main supported faction of the FAP, with them lasting longer than the other two factions until disbanded in 1976.
- FAP Comando Nacional: This group continued armed actions and opposed electoral participation, claiming responsibility for the assassinations of union leaders Dirk Kloosterman and Marcelino Mansilla in 1973. The faction is a much more armed and capable force than the two when it comes to their guerilla warfare.
- FAP 17 de Octubre: Formed by Envar El Kadri, this faction advocated for a popular rebellion and the dissolution of corrupt institutions. The weaker faction of the three which got hit hard after the crackdown.

Brief Description: An armed wing from Workers' Revolutionary Party in Argentina, dubbed as the PRT. The PRT originally was a communist party with Trotskyist tradition, or at least emerged from its idea. They later turned to Maoist tradition, especially in their emphasis for Cultural Revolution which was inspired by Mao’s policies. By the 1960’s, due to Guevara influence, they adopted the foco strategy. This is where the ERP was originated from. Amongst all dissident groups in Argentina, the ERP is possibly one of the few groups that had been successful in their guerilla operations in Argentina. Founded by Mario Roberto Santucho, the group operated with similar tactics like other revolutionary left-wing groups in Argentina through a more armed approach. The group’s existence lasted for 6 years until 1976 until a few of their leaders, including Santucho was killed during conflict with the Argentinian army.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369667765459222578/image.png?ex=699667c2&is=69951642&hm=410c1ede3d49b6c84e38f2c9c4003305e3a50cc66ce542033ba15492af353235&",""

1. Urban Guerilla Warfare:
The ERP established their first base in urban areas before reaching out the rural ones instead. From 1970 to 1972, there had been a series of attacks made by the ERP. This includes bank robberies to fund operations (Assault on BANADE was a famous case), attack on police stations and military depots, etc. There are a few notable cases in which can be break down:
- Infiltration & Diversion: The ERP was well known to infiltrate bases in urban areas. They can deploy their own agents or informants to scout, spy and possibly stealing data from the nearby bases. Some of their agents are consisted of Argentine soldiers who are secretly ERP members (Seizure of Communications Battalion 141 was a famous case to cover this). The group was considered to be swift in their operations, thanks to their cells’ operations, further helping them gained notoriety during its era. Their operations on attacking a few places can be considered diversionary in which they tried to divide the security forces 
- Bank Robberies: The actions in order to get funds for their operation came from enacting bank robberies. In early 1969, the ERP robbed the Bank of the Province of Belén de Escobar, making off a rough estimate of $213,000 from that event. The bank robbery only continued from then on, becoming one of the most famous bank robberies in Argentina: the robbery on National Development Bank (BANADE) in 1972. As a result, about 450 million pesos were robbed from that bank, sparked a widespread news about the group’s heist. The event gave a political struck into the Argentine government due to the bank’s location being near to Presidential Palace.","",""

During these attacks, the groups killed multiple police officers, while having a few of their own died. Yet these terror attacks attracted more people to the PRT, which gave early successes to the growth of PRT and its armed group: the ERP. Bombings and arson targeting police stations, military installations, multinational companies, and government offices were conducted by the groups. Bombings targeted on the police stations, military depots and other important buildings, were done out of different objectives, from pure terror attacks, sending political messages, or simply to capture then looted the areas.
- Assassinations & Kidnappings: Killing of key political, military, and business figures (especially American-linked ones) were enacted to intentionally giving political message to the Argentinian government during the 1970’s. In 1972, ERP guerrillas stormed the house of Principal Commander Pedro Agarotti of the National Gendarmerie, killed him in a hail of gunfire with a cold blood. At the same year, members of the ERP murdered Oberdan Sallustro, an Italian businessman they had previously kidnapped before. Kidnappings were also done in order to get ransom, in which by 1973, a ransom of one million U.S. dollars was paid to freed Aaron Beilenson.","",""

Surprisingly the operation went without any bloodshed, as the militants manage to take the soldiers by surprise, capturing them before they can even do anything. The guerrillas seized a significant amount of weaponry, including FN FAL 7.62mm rifles, PAM 9mm submachine guns, 11.25mm pistols, corresponding ammunition, and two 12.7mm heavy machine guns. The weapons were loaded onto a small Unimog military truck. This operation marked how swift and effective the ERP proved themselves to be in urban warfare.","",""

Compared to some guerilla or dissident groups in Argentina, the group was in fact, more organized. The ERP's structure was pyramidal and militaristic, comprising several levels which include:
- Squad (Escuadra): The smallest unit, consisting of 8 to 12 combatants, led by a sergeant. Possibly the average smaller cell groups that operated autonomously under the central command of ERP.
- Platoon (Pelotón): Formed by three squads, totaling 20 to 30 members, commanded by a lieutenant. It can possibly be suspected being consisted of 3 cell groups.
- Company (Compañía): Composed of three platoons, approximately 90 combatants, led by a captain and supported by a staff.
- Battalion (Batallón): Made up of three companies, with 250 to 300 combatants, commanded by a commander with a staff.
There are two main zone established by the ERP, Urban Zone & Rural Zone. The Urban Zone was centered in Buenos Aires, focusing on city-based operations. Meanwhile the Rural Zone was centered in Tucuman, focusing on countryside guerrilla activities. Each zone had specific units, such as the ""Compañía de Monte Ramón Rosa Jiménez"" in Tucumán and urban companies like ""Decididos de Córdoba"" and ""Combate de San Lorenzo"" in Paraná. These units were part of larger battalions, such as the ""Batallón urbano José de San Martín"" in Buenos Aires.","",""

In 1975, the ERP attempted to create a rural base in Argentina, specifically in Tucuman. The main aim is to establish a ""revolutionary foco"" in Tucumán Province as liberated zone. This sparked the Operation Independence in 1975 to 1977, where the Argentinian military aimed to crush the guerilla rebellion in Tucuman Province. During the war, the ERP reportedly used these tactics inside the rural province:
- Infiltration & Disguise: During their operation against the Argentinian military in Tucuman, reports stated that these guerillas used infiltration and disguises. On 28th May, 1975, the ERP along with Montoneros groups took the Argentinian military by surprise as they wore Argentinian military uniforms. The attack proved how the ERP can gain intelligence and infiltration on the army’s positions. As a matter of fact, most of ERP operation in Tucuman was mostly ambushes, in which gave them the only advantage in surprises in rural battlegrounds. Other tactic being used through infiltration was poisoning. In one case, Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas managed to discovered the soups that was sent to him and his army were poisoned due to suspicion with the texture of the soup. As a result, the mass poisoning was averted yet proved how the infiltration tactics used by the ERP can resulted into a sabotage or attempt at poisoning their targeted enemies.","",""

The Argentine military had to resort sending their elite units to do “search-and-destroy” missions, blowing out hideouts while capturing or killing ERP members. In return, the ERP and Monteneros conducted assassination missions against various military members of Argentina. As a result of these tactics, the Argentinian military suffered some significant losses though gradually won against the guerillas groups.

The ERP was reportedly allied itself not only with their own groups, but also other revolutionary groups inside Argentina or outside Argentine. The ERP was historically allied with Argentinian guerilla groups such as Montoneros, Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR) and Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas (FAP). Meanwhile outside of Argentina, they were allied with Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (Chile) and Tupamaros (Uruguay). Their power in networking mainly came from allying with other guerilla revolutionary groups. They were also politically supported by Cuba, as their Guevarism movement was emphasized inside the rural warfare in Tucuman Province. Even after their defeats in Argentina, the ERP had escaped into Central America, with their networks gained them a chance to establish their grounds in Nicaragua. Later, a few that escaped from Argentina, returned to Argentina during 1980’s to form another revolutionary group, such as Movimiento Todos por la Patria (MTP).","",""

Brief Description: A far-left and Roman Catholic Peronist faction that formed itself out of belief in “liberation theology,” a mix of ideas inspired by Cuban revolution and socialist workers-priests. The group operated their guerilla revolutionary actions from 1970 to 1983, where they technically founded in 1969, but managed to be fully formed in early months of 1970, as a result of the convergence of several armed Peronist groups with Catholic roots. Camilo Torres Commando of Buenos Aires was considered to be the founding group of the faction, in which figures such as Fernando Abal Medina, Carlos Ramus, Norma Arrostito, Mario Firmenich, Carlos Alberto Maguid, Graciela Daleo, among others were known as the founding figures. Montoneros was constituted as a political-military organization (OPM). This meant rejecting the dual model that had traditionally been adopted by other insurrectional experiences (Leninism, Maoism, Castroism, Sandinismo, Vietnam, Ireland, etc.), which separated the military organization from the political organization, in which the military become its main wings. The group died in 1983 when the leader had been arrested along with government actions in capturing the influential members of this group.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369668496480538778/image.png?ex=69966870&is=699516f0&hm=721a3c0df01589432ae1422c5f4e1d263615c46b6e582338a8d9cb189a330c82&",""

There are a few things that the Montoneros had done in order to enact their operations. Their first operation began in 1970 when they had made a sensation to their actions, which will be covered in pointers as the following:
- Assassination & Kidnapping: the Montoneros first action in 1970 was to kidnapping and executing General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, who had led the 1955 coup against Juan Perón. This action was considered a revenge or revolutionary justice as some might called it. Either way, they continued their operation of kidnapping and assassinating other figures such as Arturo Mor Roig, former minister of Argentina in 1974, Cesáreo Ángel Cardozo & Carlos Omar Actis in 1976. A few other people were kidnapped before later on they were murdered, with one of them even include an US agent, such as John Patrick Egan, a consular agent in Córdoba by 1975, only two days after his kidnapping. In their operations, the Montoneros reported to use a bomb, especially during of Cesáreo Ángel Cardozo where he was killed using a bomb planted by a young 18 years old Montoneros member who befriended his daughter to gain information about him, before planting it under his bedroom.","",""

These tactics involved swift, surprise attacks on military and police targets, followed by rapid withdrawals to avoid prolonged engagements. A few of these operations frequently utilized stolen vehicles. One famous case was the Toma de La Calera in 1970 in which the Montoneros enacted their attack by using four vehicles, with one camouflaged as a police car. After the operation, a mechanical failure forced some members to hijack another car to escape from the scene as they’ve managed to raid a few facilities in La Calera. Other cases include them using their tactics to steal weapons and caches for their own ranks. The most ambitious plan was the infamous Operation Primicia in 1975. The Montoneros hijacked an Aerolíneas Argentinas Boeing 737 with 102 passengers and redirected it to Formosa. Simultaneously, they seized the Formosa International Airport and launched an assault on the 29th Infantry Regiment's barracks. After that, they’ve managed to land to remote areas to escape capture, gaining public fame for their actions. At the same year, Montoneros participated in an assault on the army supply base Domingo Viejobueno in Monte Chingolo, Buenos Aires along with ERP (though failed despite the scale of numbers that the guerilla forces had mustered).","",""

These allowed members to pass through checkpoints, rent properties, and conduct other activities without revealing their true identities. An example of this tactic was observed during Operation Condor, where captured Montoneros were impersonated using fake documents to prevent alerting other members of their capture. They utilized clandestine methods for communication to coordinate activities without interception. Information was shared on a need-to-know basis to minimize the risk of exposure.
- Safehouses: Safe houses were essential for the Montoneros to conceal their activities and personnel. They were used to store arms, explosives, and other materials necessary for guerrilla operations. Members sought refuge in these houses to avoid capture and to recover from operations. In one notable instance, a safe house in Villa Ballester was discovered to contain a significant cache of weapons, including submachine guns, rifles, and ammunition, indicating the scale of operations being planned.","",""

By the later phase, the Montoneros collaborated with the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group that had established a rural insurgency in Tucumán. While the ERP had a more entrenched presence in the rural areas, the Montoneros provided logistical support and sent observers to the region. It wasn't until early 1976 that the Montoneros established a permanent rural force, known as the ""Fuerza de Monte,"" aiming to create a liberated zone in the mountainous terrains of Tucumán. They sent a few observers in fighting with the ERP in joint operation against the Argentinian military. Similarly like the ERP, they enacted jungle and mountain warfare, with their own distinct tactic of sabotaging. The Montoneros conducted sabotage missions targeting infrastructure, such as the bombing of an Air Force C-130 transport aircraft at the Tucumán airbase on August 28, 1975. Despite their efforts, the Montoneros faced heavy attack from the Argentinian military, with more members died in helping the ERP. The final nail to the coffin for their rural guerilla efforts was in the battle of Acheral One of the most significant engagements occurred on October 8, 1975, near Acheral. A group of Montoneros was ambushed by the military, resulting in the deaths of twelve guerrillas. This battle marked a turning point, leading to the decision to withdraw many guerrilla members from rural operations back to urban centers. Only the ERP managed to hold themselves much longer, yet even then, they had declined by their strength to be able in sustaining the battlefield along with helping the Montoneros.

Brief Description: Another leftist Peronist faction, yet instead of inspired by the Catholic nationalists, they were inspired by the Marxist-Leninist ideas and Guevarist movement in Bolivia. The FAR originated mainly from the Communist Party and the Communist Youth Federation, under the leadership of Carlos Olmedo and Roberto Quieto, with an ideology very different from the Christian Peronism. They became notorious due to their small but effective operations in Bueno Aires, in which they had began their operations from 1967 to 1973. Progressively, FAR and Montoneros began to align ideologically and carry out joint actions, eventually merging in 1973.

1. Urban Guerilla Warfare:
Their only main operations were enacted inside the urban areas, mainly in Bueno Aires, just like other revolutionary groups in 1960’s to 1970’s. They adopted a distinct blend of urban guerrilla warfare, propaganda of the deed, and politico-military doctrine rooted in Marxist-Leninist and Guevarist thought.
- Terrorism: The group first action during its operation in 1969 immediately started with fire to thirteen Minimax supermarkets in Buenos Aires. A few bombings were reported during their operation in 1970 when they took over the town of Garín in Buenos Aires Province for an hour, marking their public emergence. They even managed to take over important buildings such as the ENTEL (national telecommunications company) office, the train station, and the police station.
- Bank Robberies: In order to fund their group, the FAR deployed a few operations in assaulting then robbed a few banks throughout 1970 to 1971. The group robbed an army bank in the city of Córdoba, stealing at least $15,000.00 on December 29, 1970.

On July 1, 1972, the group assassinated General Juan Carlos Sánchez in an ambush using FN FAL rifles and PAM submachine guns during a joint operation with the ERP in the city of Rosario. On January 22, 1973, FAR members assassinated Julián Moreno, a union leader from the UOM (Metalworkers Union), and his driver, Deheza, who was driving an Argentine Ford Falcon in the city of Avellaneda, Buenos Aires. These series of operation required them to use stolen vehicles or camouflaged ones, with the members infiltrate then use hit and run tactics to quickly eliminate their targets.
- Attack On Authority: The group make some attacks against the police and military forces, in which they stole weapons and caches to fill the armaments of their groups. On April 1, 1971, the group (FAR) attacked a police substation located in Villa Elvira, in the province of Buenos Aires, where they stole four Browning Hi-Power 9mm pistols, a 16-gauge shotgun, a .22 caliber revolver, ammunition, uniforms, belts, and other items useful for their campaign.

Brief Description: FAL was a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla organization active in Argentina from 1967 to 1973. FAL's roots trace back to the late 1950s, evolving from the ""Grupo Praxis"" led by Silvio Frondizi. By the mid-1960s, it functioned as a front uniting Guevarist and radical Peronist tendencies. Some columns, like the Masetti Brigade, dissolved in the early 1970s, while others integrated into groups like the PRT-ERP. The main characteristic of the Frente Argentino de Liberación (FAL) was its organization into autonomous columns based on a set of fundamental principles: armed struggle as a method of intervention, anti-imperialism, and opposition to the dictatorship. By 1975, the group had been split into several groups with some members entered Argentinian politics, further destroyed by the government forces for its remnants.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1369666572687245436/1369669110052556841/image.png?ex=69966903&is=69951783&hm=96ccb33ac4ef14396031bae8cbc3d07910d9a08d44b4bbf21d81855d73bd869e&",""

1. Urban Guerilla Warfare:
The FAL enacted their operation with an intention that they can ridicule the government to gain people’s support. The organization gained their superiority through these following tactics that they enacted in Bueno Aires:
- Robbery & Disguises: Their first action of operation was in 1972, they carried out a robbery at the Military Geographic Institute located on Cabildo Street in Buenos Aires, following a year of planning. Two of the members performed mandatory military service at the institution made a wax mold of the key to the Armory Room, which was used to create a duplicate key that allowed them to enter undetected. Though the group claimed no responsibility, it is most likely that they deployed this operation secretly. They also raided Civil Registry office and stole blank identity documents, which they used to forge fake identities for their next operations. After these operations, they exploit group members who worked in banks, they redirected client checkbooks to their own addresses, and one member would cash the checks using the forged identities they had obtained, imitating the signatures. In this way, they obtained enough money to buy between 11 and 13 plots of land in Greater Buenos Aires. Other robbery attempts include the robbery of the Provincial Bank of Córdoba, in the Unión department, then into Clínica Mayo in La Plata, where surgical equipment was stolen by the group, and theft of a truck full of poultry in Córdoba, whose cargo was later distributed in a poor neighborhood, all done in 1970. They also launched an ambitious operation by raiding a train called El Rosarino train, in which money and weapons from the escort guards were stolen by them.","",""

The operation went smoothly with no casualties reported, as the group was also prepared in that year to do an assault on a payroll train, posing as Air Force personnel. Yet this plan was spoiled, and authorities busted down their base of operation. This surprise attack was done out of the FAL’s objective to spark media attention while painting their government as simply incompetent to gain confidence for revolution. However, in the near future, the group found out that kidnapping did a much better work to create more attention from the media.
- Kidnapping: In 1970, the group enacted a kidnapping operation on a Paraguayan consul Waldemar Sánchez. The incident received widespread media coverage in which they managed to gain even more attention by emphasizing humanitarian principle. The government rejected the guerilla demands, yet only for the group to released the Paraguayan consul with no injuries. This event sparked international notoriety as for possibly the first time in Argentina’s history, a guerilla group act according to their principles of humanitarian agenda. However, barely two months later in 1970, the event was eclipsed by the kidnapping and subsequent murder of Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, and no one remembered the consul for the next four decades.","",""

- Masseti Brigade
- FAL “Columna Inti-Peredo”
In the long run, these factions dissolved, either reuniting with the original FAL or merging with other guerrilla groups. Some of the splinter groups called on the population to vote in the March 1973 elections, in which they expressed support for the Justicialist Liberation Front.

Brief Description: A short-lived guerilla organization that similarly like some revolutionary left in Argentina, adopted Marxist-Leninist approach in its operation in Salta. Led by Jorge Ricardo Masetti, the group aimed to initiate a revolutionary movement inspired by the Cuban Revolution as a few of them were experienced Cubans. However, the EGP's activities were short-lived. In March 1964, the Argentine Gendarmerie captured one of the EGP's camps and detained five of its members. The remaining guerrillas found themselves surrounded, with the Gendarmerie controlling all access routes to and from the forested area, effectively dismantling the group's operational capabilities, while Masetti was never found with his mysterious disappearances. Though only lived for a year, their appearance marked a premature rise of some foreign intervention in arousing a revolution in Argentina. One thing to be noted when they were observed, was that they are pretty well-armed before enacting their operation in Argentina. Their first military objective was the gendarmerie post at Aguas Blancas, which deemed by many of its group to be not suitable for capturing. Furthermore, the conditions in the jungles along with poor leadership caused hunger, diseases, and other factors killed the guerilla groups despite their attempt to survive for almost a year.

The group never managed to make its famous achievement in enacting their guerilla attacks like the others. They were already destroyed by the Argentinian military in 1978, with several members had been attacked, captured or disappeared without traces. Not much was really known about this group other than a few interviews on former members of the group.

10. Movimiento Todos por la Patria (MTP)
Brief Description: Founded by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo while operating from 1985 to 1989. The group can be considered a branch that was inspired by the ERP considering Merlo himself used to fight for the ERP in the 1970’s, along with other original members of MTP used to be a part of PRT-ERP, making the group another Marxist-Leninist and Guevarist revolutionary dissident. The group originated from the magazine group known as Entre Todos, which gathered popular youth support before transitioning into MTP. Some of those who would later become prominent members of the MTP (Movimiento Todos por la Patria), held significant positions within the Intransigent Party (Partido Intransigente, or PI) between 1984 and 1985, which brings more PI members to the guerilla group. Internal split did happen in 1987, just a year after their formation, yet in their greatest effort, managed to carried out one of the famous battles between the insurgents against Argentina military. Yet it failed badly, which caused the demise of the group by 1989. Thus, the only way to analyse their combat styles was through their one and only battle known as the 1989 attack on La Tablada barracks.","",""

Premise: Emboldened by a series of events happened in Argentina, including several military uprisings or mutinies in Argentina by the army, the MTP believed that they were capable to enact an attack to establish their base. Enrique Gorriarán Merlo and his group believed that they can achieve a similar victory due to their past experience in enacting revolutionary movement to topple the Nicaraguan government in 1979 during the Nicaraguan revolution event. There were speculations on how their attack failed against the Argentinian military, but a few theories provided that the MTP may be lacking in the Argentinian general situation due to Merlo himself was imprisoned before the attack for quite some time without having updated information in Argentina. Other theories speculated that the Argentinian military may try to provoke the MTP to enact a premature attack on their base to catch them off-guard. Either way the attack was commenced in early 1989 by January with the MTP aimed for the La Tablada barracks, where the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Regiment reside. 
- Vehicle Tactic: The MTP managed to do an early breakthrough to the military base by ramming into the entrance. The MTP members disguised themselves with Argentinian military uniforms, which surprised and overpowered the guards at the main gate, allowing more attackers to enter. About 80 members of the MTP joined this attack.
- Coordinated Multi-Front Assault: The MTP members quickly spread themselves out in multiple smaller groups, capturing other key buildings of the barracks: the armory, command post, communications center, and troop quarters. After initial success, the attackers dug in and tried to hold positions within the barracks. They believed this show of strength could trigger a popular uprising or mobilization of left-wing sectors in their support.","",""

While the broader movement faded, a radical core managed to stand, especially among anarchist and autonomist currents that rejected both Peronism and electoral politics. By 2010, a younger generation of militants, heavily influenced by that collapse and inspired by global movements, began forming small, decentralized cells. These anarchist groups were different from the other anarchist groups back in the Cold War era. They were strongly influenced by Greek and Chilean insurrectionary anarchism, especially The Conspiracy of Cells of Fire (from Greece) and Chilean student/anarchist movements, some of which used incendiary devices against banks or public offices.
