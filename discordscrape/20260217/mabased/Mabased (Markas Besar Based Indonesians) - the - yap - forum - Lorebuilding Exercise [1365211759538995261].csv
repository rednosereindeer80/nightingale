**Lorebuilders** are individuals who identify emerging ideas and understand their historical context while taking in collective sentiments, and weaving them into a coherent and compelling narrative that invites others to contribute to. They are the lore’s prophets. Skilled lorebuilders do not dictate a direction; they listen, act as stewards to it while remaining responsive to the lore’s natural evolution. Lorebuilding cannot be faked or bought. It must be lived into and experienced.","",""

If a lore crosses a certain threshold and is powerful enough, it will attract new classes of people who contribute with their own rituals, memes, bits, and actions. Like rings forming on a tree trunk, these contributions mark the growth of the lore with each passing generation, each bringing fresh meaning and momentum.

The three levels of the effectiveness of lore are attention, feeling, and co-creator. The first level, attention, is when people are focusing some amount of energy toward the lore without being fully invested in it. The second level, feeling, is when people begin to feel invested in it and begin to form a sense of identity with it. The third and final level is that of co-creator, where people feel so invested in the lore that they begin to contribute to it in their own ways. This could be as trivial as an inside joke or copypasta, or as impactful as a landmark event or new narrative that attracts a new cohort of community members.

At its core, lorebuilding is a collective narrative creation exercise shaped by shared experience. In its highest form, it transforms repeated actions and memes into a common culture, something people feel a sense of belonging to and act upon, and creates a lineage to be passed down to future generations.","",""

Bitcoin begins with its Genesis Lorebuilder, Satoshi Nakamoto, who conceived of it in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It was the first time in decades that people seriously questioned the modern political and financial world order and imagined alternatives. In the original whitepaper, Bitcoin was described as a “Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” rooted in the idea of sovereign money dictated by code rather than human institutions. Properties like decentralization, censorship resistance, and scarcity were embedded directly into the protocol.

Bitcoin wasn’t the first attempt at digital money; DigiCash, Bit Gold, and Hashcash came before it. But what Satoshi did was combine what worked from those efforts (Proof of Work, Digital Signatures, Scarcity) and integrate them into a complete system while also introducing new elements, like the longest chain rule and the halving mechanism.

Satoshi planted the seed of Bitcoin, etching into the genesis block the message: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” From its earliest days, it was the community that took it upon themselves to help proliferate Bitcoin. Their contributions, like coining principles of pseudonymity, memes like “HODL,” rituals like Bitcoin Pizza Day, or trauma-bonding events like Mt. Gox that birthed “Not your keys, not your coins”, became lore.

The history of Bitcoin through a lorebuilding lens could be an article itself, but some notable lorebuilders and the eras that defined them include, Satoshi and the cypherpunks, who defined the founding principles, Dread Pirate Roberts and the Silk Road Era, who proved Bitcoin’s first real use case, Roger Ver (""Bitcoin Jesus""), who helped fund the first generation of startups, and Michael Saylor and the Wall Street Era, who brought Bitcoin into the institutional fold.","",""
