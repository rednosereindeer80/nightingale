Pertama kali gue melihat ADLV itu maybe di sosmed, and that time, ADLV lagi viral banget di korea. i saw those bear pictures on those tees and all i know is that i hate their design. apa ya... JELEK aja gitu? seems to be very lazy with the design and really have no artistic value in my eyes. one way to another, ADLV mulai masuk indonesia and i do still hate it at that time lol. harganya pun gabisa gue justifikasi, because like wdym 1 kaos ADLV harganya bisa nyentuh 1 million???? crazy asf. this hatred juga mulai menyebar di pertemanan gue bcs i always told em about HOW I HATE THIS SPECIFIC BRAND, dan how all my friends always joking around buying their tees for me

HOWEVER, tiba-tiba beberapa bulan lalu w melihat collaboration between ADLV and gundam, and it's DOPE ASF???? like, HOLUP NOW ADLV I DUNNO U CAN BE COOL LIKE THIS? like, i saw all of the articles of the collab and i must say, i'm kinda tempted to buy one of them joints. its not tacky at all, the brand logo doesn't interfere with the gundam design, and C'MON NOW ITS GUNDAM?????? THAT SHID COOL ASF!

This collab actually makes me look at ADLV in different light, since they could pull a drip like this. even though i still hate their actual design and/or basic tees, i do rate this collab highly and let's see if ADLV can justify their price tags again with another collaborations like this one.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1441330534406946816/25FW-TP-ZP-CO-GDU-BLK6.webp?ex=699613ea&is=6994c26a&hm=13c977c7a818833900148e4f426366a8e959b496a646a8a20e91fece4ff7fd6a&",""

So.... I stumbled upon this thing when I was researching about how much different variation you can get from every NFL game, and this happened because NFL have a different points depending on how you score on the game. For those of you that didn't know, there are different points that u can get in a game, such as 6 point for touchdown, 3 for field goal/kicking, and 1 point for successful kick after a touchdown. From various combinations, we can deduct on how popular certain score is, and which score is not as popular.

Scorigami itself  is a concept thought up by American Journalist and Humorist Jon Bois. It is the art of building final scores that have never happened before in NFL history. Due to the unique nature of how points are scored in American Football, where it is impossible to score 1 point on its own, as well as the rarity of the 2 point safety and 8 point touchdown and 2 point conversion, there are a lot of scores that are possible, but have never happened.

After I know all about scorigami, I started to check the website, reddit thread, and social medias regarding is there any updates toward the scorigami. I remember the last updates to the scorigami is on November 16, 2025 when the Buffalo Bills win against Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the score of 44 - 32.  When I saw the recent update to the scorigami, I feel... hyped(?) for no reason. I feel like scorigami in a way is just another type of collectibles, since you can never guess and predict the outcome of the game. There are more ""common"" scores like 20 - 17, which occurred like 298 times and 27 - 24 that occurred 240 times, but yeah there are also some ""rarer"" scores and unique/SSR games that only happened once in a lifetime (for now) that just add more layer to scorigami itself. All and all, I like scorigami, collecting things are cool, and NFL please ban tush push ❤️","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1441630142899421236/518384214_10172561320770271_4908495346655839254_n.jpg?ex=69968232&is=699530b2&hm=8b9230c511905a55793157bd94193a06ccf995b2bdc065ac8b30cdc99f149899&",""

basically, it's a list of countries that not particularly  a part of or a member of european union, but they're participating in a lot of things that ties to european politics and cultures (yes it's pointless but bear with me pls). some of the reason why these countries are participating in european thingy is because they want to join some better league, or the big boy league bcs they feel like they could be profited or compete on a higher level. institutions like Council of Europe (CoE) is open for countries outside of EU as long as they're following EU's protocol about various things such as human rights and contributions to the institutions. they could be an observer countries or actively helping to the cause of CoE itself. 

other things like the UEFA Champions League (UCL) and Eurobasket also open for countries that want to join, and thats why countries like Israel and teams like Fenerbache can compete to win UEFA trophies. a lot of times they join UEFA or European Sport League because they feel like ""too good"" in their own region and/or rejected from the said region. all and all, a lot of these countries are trying to fight because these trophies seems to be more ""prestige"" and cool (?) by default.

so for a couple of months now, i've been obsessed with chunky shoes or ""dad"" shoes. i personally think that they always looks cool in a flawless, effortless way. i do also find how easy it is to mix and match dad shoes to my usual outfits. even though a lot of people also points out things like ""Y2K aesthetics"" and ""boomer vibes"" with the shoes, me personally looks at it in a nostalgic way, how a lot of older streetwear and brands used to create a lot of shoes with this type of silhouettes as well. it keep reminds me of the day where yeezy drops are a hype and a moment of itself, and also the core foundation of skateboarding culture as well, since a lot of skateboard shoes are also chunky.

but i do have some ick about those chunky shoes, especially when they're overdoing it. what i mean is silhouettes that just didn't make any sense and just ugly to begin with. i'm talking about FILA Disruptors, Converse Run Star Motion, UGGs, and those pink Crocs Clogs. wdym they deserve a spot in a chunky shoes tier? in the world where Yeezy 700 and NB 990 exist, i don't think that they belong in the same ""genes"". i do agree that those shoes are chunky af and also gives u some height, but chunky shoes is not always about that. chunky shoes (despite being called ugly shoes) is a culture of its own, have their old-school silhouettes, and also need to give you those ""nostalgic"" feelings when ur wearing it, so if your favorite shoes are listed before, sorry to say that they're not a chunky/ dad shoes in my book.

all and all, i'll say that dad shoes are great, not every chunky shoes can be categorized into dad shoes, and i hate and love you kardashians to popularized this style of shoe ❤️ .

my top 5 of dad shoes (rn):
- Adidas Ozweego
- Nike Vomero
- Asics Gel Kayano 14 (and jjjjound collab!)
- Yeezy 700 & 500

1. even though this is the 3rd time nike re-released the ronaldinho tiempo, you can always feel the subtle difference in between every release. for this 2025 release, you get the small chain with the ""R"" lace jewel. other subtle design is the gradient on the midsole and studs and also metallic gold swoosh, which really makes this shoe feels more special in every way.

2. they also create the lifestyle version of the shoe, which is very dope. although i must say, i **do** aware that people who bought the lifestyle version often wear that joints to small cafes in menteng and listening bar in senopati, but everytime nike or other shoe brand make a lifestyle version out of their football cleats, its always a pleasure to see. example: T90 silver bullet (yes no more explanations thx). so yeah.... other than ""oooohhh its not the true habitat of the shoes"" i have nothing more to say regarding how cool the lifestyle version is.

3. this shoes is re-released once every 10 years (dated back to 2005). idk how many times nike will re-release this tiempo again, but if ur thinking abt getting this shoes, i suggest get it now bcs u'll never know when nike will re-released it again in the future.","",""

i collect various types of legos since i was a little kid, and i remember those days where lego have their own franchises that is unique and also very cool to see, such as Bionicles, Hero Factories, Power Miner, and Mars Missions. these days, the only lego's franchise that still kinda survived is the ninjago franchise which, isn't that bad in my opinion, but probably bcs it's not there when i was a little, i have little to no interest for that specific franchise. these days if we're talking about legos, we all can agree that its getting more realistic as they taken more realistic license like the monalisa, fender (the guitar brand), and nintendo. those collab isn't bad at all, but sometimes i just missed my old franchises y'know? those janky-wasteland robot look that bionicle, or the mecha/zoid look of the hero factories is also very eye-catching for me, even till this day. 

basically, the short reason why lego are discontinuing those franchises is because the re-launch for it are flopped. the other reason why is because lego didn't want to make another mold for their parts. since legos are made from plastic and molded with a machine, every piece have their own unique mold. if they want to create another ""unique"" molds like what they do to bionicle parts like their head, torso and feets, they need to spend more money just to create a unique mold for (almost) every part, and its not good economically. lego also share that they always trying to put existing mold/shape into sets and trying to be as unique as possible. thats why u can found sausage shape in titanic set, frog in sakura tree set, and lego hat in cactus set. lego also trying to commit to long term sustainability project starting in 2024, by choosing more sustainable materials, use recyclable packaging, and reduce greenhouse emission.","",""

1. the hype was there, but the second drop for the OG colorway takes too long and ppl already moving on to another trend
2. adidas didn't create ""scarcity"" for the drop, making sure that everyone can get a pair and didn't qualify it as a ""grail"" on their second drop.
3. other brand (specifically air jordan) already crowned as the goat shoe brand at that time, and adidas couldn't compete with that.

Adidas eventually drop the second silhouette for NMD with the OG color and everything, but it was too late (and the silhouette is ugly too imho). sneakers already becoming a bigger market and Nike is leading far and beyond with other hits like Air Jordan 11 ""Space Jam"" or even Nike Kobe 6 ""The Grinch"".

Murakami put his signature characters and color popped palette that immediately become pop-cultural status symbols. we can see celebrities like paris hilton and pharell williams waring this article and the collab itself even made its way to movies like mean girls. this collab so popular that it stays in the store for 12 years and the resale price continue to climb through the roof.

nowadays, LV doing their 3rd collabs with Murakami, with Zendaya as its ambassador. LV x murakami shows the uniqueness once again with the cherries, cherry blossom, and the iconic monogram superflat panda to welcome the season. this collab isn't only important because of the culture, but also because its signalling full-circle fashion moment that people don't wanna miss out on. if the first collab was, in Marc Jacobs words, a monumental marriage between art and business, this latest collab is aiming for global domination.","",""

in 2025, we've seen all sort of trends in fashion and quarter zip is probably just one of them. but this trend, and the memes revolving the trend itself.... is amazing. i saw how those so-called ""young gentleman"" swapping their look that usually consist of shiesty, nike techs and black air force to quarter zip, khakis, and dress shoes. the color pick is also drastically different as well. nike tech are popular for their fierce and bold colors like red, navy, and aqua blue, while this same people are choosing burgundy, nude, and ash for their quarter zip. after the wardrobe change, they also tend to fix their behaviors and habit for some reason. its either because they fw the change, or simply just ""looking the part"" and being performative about the shift in fashion trend itself. you can see them bringing books, glass of matcha, and also goyard duffle bag (or just duffle bag lol) as accessories of their fashion statement. not only people on social media, this trend is also actually making a movement that celebrities lean to join as well. for example, we can see central cee also rocking the quarter zip trend, even though he was one of the people that popularize nike tech back in 2024. so what happened? why..... why does is work?

i will say, the earliest time i saw the quarter zip trend on tiktok is probably around a month ago or so, where this young tiktoker rocking the zip with matcha on his hand. in the same video, he explain how he's ""elevated"", ""upgraded"",  and ""matured"" with the outfit that he choose. this isn't a rare occurrence tbh, since we've seen something like this before, where people are trying to be seen as an adult and trying to remove their ""younger"" and ""reckless"" looks. for example, we've seen how Jay-Z on his song titled ""30 something"" talking about how he's maturing and forever","",""

other than an attempt to be more mature in some way, a lot of people, especially black people, see this trend as white passing. they kinda see this quarter zip trend as an attempt to ""weaken"" black  presence and to make black people blend in the white-dominated world (their words not mine). if im being honest here, there's no issue about elevating yourself or simply wearing some sort of clothes in your life. it's not always about trying to ""fit in"", even though almost EVERY fashion trend is all about fitting into some mold of the society. the main outtakes of the quarter zip trend is that, these young gentlemen are trying to look better, to finally growing out of their old self, and reinventing themself to become some sort of this, kid in adult spaces. you're allowed to wear something a bit more ""serious"" and ""preppy"", and if the trend doesn't suit you, thats fine too. quarter zip isn't a device to turn people white anyway, its just a piece of clothing at the end of the day.

all and all, this trend is one hell of a ride that really fill my november FYP (till today sih), and i support the quarter zip movement if you're actually looking for ""that"" piece of clothing that could elevate your style to the next level. not for me tho i still enjoy my sneakers and baggy pants trend hehe.

first of all, 48 in JKT48 signifies the ties with their sister group, which is AKB48. 48 in AKB48 itself means the location of the AKB48 theater in japan, which is at Akihabara (in short, AKB), the 4th building, on 8th floor. tadaaaa, AKB48 everyone!!

second of all, i think at some point JKT48 do have 48 members, but the numbers keeps being added and reduced because new generation of member is getting added almost every year and members also graduated from the group (which could be another discussion one day). so yeah.... the answer is yes and no about the amount of members in the group. if you wanna know how many member does JKT48 have, just look at the table that i created (yes i counted manually) (yes this data is like 10+ years old) (yes i still update this thing from time to time). enjoy!

Japan is a country full of mascot that we all love and adore. Peko-chan, Kumamon, Pikachu, and Glico-man is just to name a few of them. a lot of those mascots are surviving through the years and decades of iconic logos and packaging. but earlier on november, East Japan Railway (JR East) said to retire the suica penguin, or the mascot of their contactless card payment that mainly used at train platforms. the company itself said on social media that the mascot is ""graduating"", which receiving the same treatment as some ""idol"" in japan.

the change itself isn't because of the penguin's ""lack of popularity"" or anything. the company said that they're restructuring itself to shift JR East from an old-school firm dependent on train revenue to a fintech-focused company. the company aims to change the transit card into modern mobile payment platform, a super-app offering peer-to-peer transactions and a banking back-end, along with futuristic tech that will eliminate the need for station turnstiles. they're doing this not only to ""reinvent"" themself, but to compete with other payment method like paypay that use QR payment system that's more flexible and quick. suica on the other hand seems to be inferior, especially because what they can use are limited to trains and vending machines, while other fintech apps can also provide even larger method of payment that could be used almost everywhere, which JR east want to compete.

all and all, i can see why JR east want to make this change, since the use of QR is already very large and common in japan. as a financial company, of course it's a good step forward a newer type of technology, eventho they need to retire the penguin. I do personally hope that the bronze statue at shinjuku isn't gonna be stripped down soon tho 🙂","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1446407429121380382/image.png?ex=69961724&is=6994c5a4&hm=7380cd175685a13a08bfcac2f41c9f34ea225280a6ee08223c4235ae68ec80b2&",""

As he starts to get used to the life in the dorm, Mashiro Shiina, a world-famous artist who cannot even take care of her daily life, moves in. Sorata is forced to become Mashiro's caretaker (hence the ""pet"" in the title of the anime). eventho it was called the dormitory of troublemaker, i'll say is just full of misfits that didn't really fit with the society, which really, not a bunch of bad person in a way. this anime focusing on the story between kanda and mashiro, but also involving other member of the dormitories as well, which really enrich the slice of life aspect of the anime.

what i really love about this anime, is that eventho they're focusing on the story of the 2 protagonists, we still see the connection between 3 other tenant of the dorm, which in a way, really tells you about human connection. i will say, out of 5 people in the dorm, there are 2 main character, but no NPC's. all of them got a fair share of backstories and dialogues, which hits closer to me more than anything. i can see that the anime adaptation really care about creating the world where all 5 of them are equally important, and no stories are untold. when i was finishing the anime, i felt, happy tbh. happy because everyone told their stories, because everyone stories and issues got resolved (kinda), and because this is the type of anime that actually care so much despite the lack of episodes.","",""

all and all, i'm aware that sakurasou no pet na kanojo is probably not one of the ""best"" anime in unison, or according to the majority of people, but this particular anime is special for me, and i will say, yeah, this anime is on my top 3 best anime in my opinion, so take it or leave it i guess lol.

Trench coats were a lightweight solution for wet trenches back in WW1, and bomber jackets were designed for warmth and mobility for the first fighter pilots. hell, even T-shirts were used to be use as navy undergarments.

but when the war ends, these piece of clothing need to go somewhere, somewhere with a different meaning. for example, take a look at flared pants. this pants were initially used by the navy through WW2, and the wide bottom were designed to be easy to roll up when there was water on board. the same pants was used 20 years later by students and hippies protesting Vietnam wars, with the big difference was called bellbottom pants. other example was combat boots used by the UK punk movements and French beret used by black panther movement as well. those garments doesn't lose its political meanings, but their positions in political compass surely shifted.

nowadays, a lot of these fashion items that used to have political meanings surely lost its meaning completely. cargo pants now is the cornerstone of almost every fashion look but notably for Y2K, trench coat become the staple of French romance movies, and raf simons camo bomber jacket would become a fashion grail priced at 50K or something. all and all, i will say that fashion do change in purposes, whether it was political or not, war or peace, it was something for function, and you sell it for meanings, and people buy it without understand the means and just see it as a drip, or a piece of clothing, which was intended all along.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1447248325005803550/h2pdsank.jpg?ex=69968349&is=699531c9&hm=75321de8038144766b078649cbb67707e100e991289bab2790c358931c91089a&","wpointing (3)"

back in 2023, Levi's made a collab with newjeans, which signifies their first collab with a kpop group as well. i remembered that campaign being newjeans modelling for the classic Levi's 501 series, and i instantly fell in love with the collaboration. i also remember that both newjeans and levi's said that this collab ""encourages us all to express our unique style by showing different ways to wear Levi's 501 and make it your own"", which for me, really fit their image and aesthetics as well. 501 is like one of (if not) the oldest levi's series and since newjeans also goes all in with the Y2K theme (music and aesthetic wise), it's just really fits like a glove. they offer many customizations for the 501 series and also create their own signature pants which was REALLY COOL. since i love levi's and always almost get their new threads every time i need a new, crisp jeans, it's only makes sense that i'm aiming to own this collab as well. i literally wait for the day the collab was available in indonesia as well.

once their collab hits jakarta, i immediately grab my key and went to the mall. BUT APPARENTLY, they only release it for women, and they only have their collab in women's size, which really sucks, but life goes on (and i still bought a cargo from there hehe i love u levi's). it's not the end of the story tho since u saw the title lol. the next day, i was invited by levi's to attend one of their workshop where i can customize my jeans to have Newjeans' exclusive jacrons (the leather patch behind ur pants) and their exclusive friendship bracelet (which i turned into chains) FOR FREE. i was like...

since american military base was placed in okinawa in 1945, the wave of american culture and heritage hits japan like a wave. a lot of younger generation of japanese was captivated by its culture like outfit, lifestyle, and cuisine, marking the new trend of ""americana"" culture in japan. one of the teenagers back then that got influenced by the americana wave was a young hiroki nakamura, which later become the creator of visvim, which ill cover more in this thread. nakamura later move to alaska, which later gives him some time exploring rural america and growing his love for snowboarding that land him his most important gig, which is a design job for japanese division of burton snowboarding company. this gig also revived his obsession towards american clothing and footwear, particularly work boots and moccasins. with that obsession, nakamura later decided to create his own label, named visvim.

what i love with visvim is that it's different from other japanese americana label. while many japanese labels draw inspiration from ivy and american workwear, visvim abandoned that and delved deep into ancient folk customs. i mean, nakamura's first work of visvim was a sneaker that fused native american moccasins with hi-tech sneakers technologies. even after that, nakamura still fuse a lot of cultural design and inspirations while designing visvim drops. heavy wool coats from tibet, hand-dyed blankets from navajo reservations and colourful folk art from Guatemala is only a few of the inspirations behind his design, which is very cool to me. other reason why i love this brand is because of his future vintage idea.","",""

all and all, i will say that visvim is great, and the least greatest thing about it is the price. so yeah...... i need that moccasin for cheaper pls thx nakamura-san 🙏","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1448242996159053946/visvim-history-philosophy-and-iconic-products-visvim-advert-from-2008-via-filmorama.png?ex=69962d25&is=6994dba5&hm=30695971ad58043705728791fea10db7df8a3bc84168b851f3040ac113d892ee&",""

basically, all 4 types is just a varieties of pinot grapes, which have distinct characteristics. pinot grape itself originated from burgundy, france, and the name pinot translated into ""pine"", describing the cone-like shape of the grape bunches. ok so back to the 4 pinots ok sorry

- blanc is a white grape and produces dry wines with good acidity and aromas of white fruit, citrus and flowers. Its mainly grown in italy, germany and austria and is often used in the production of sparkling and semi-sparkling wines.

- noir is a red grape variety and produces medium to light-bodied wines with aromas of red fruits, spices and earth. It is grown mainly in france, germany, and specifically california and is often used in the production of champagne and sparkling wines, as well as the great red wines of Burgundy.

- gris is a white grape variety that produces dry, light and fresh wines with aromas of white fruit, citrus and flowers. It originated in Italy and is now cultivated all over the world, especially in germany and france.

- meunier is a red grape that is often used in the production of champagne and sparkling wines. It produces smooth, fruity and aromatic wines with red fruit and spice aromas. It is mainly cultivated in france, but also in belgium and germany.

so yeah... basically, noir and meunier are red grapes, while blanc and gris are white grapes. noir and meunier are often used in the production of champagne, sparkling and large red wines, while blanc and gris are used in the production of dry and sparkling wines (there u go) (i'm not good at explaining wine i only know how to drink sorry)

all and all, those are the 4 type of pinot that i know, and i bought riesling instead of either of the pinots hehe. lemme know if u want me to talk more abt wine or spirits in general!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1448578168515592232/CarnerosPinotNoirTasting.png?ex=699613cc&is=6994c24c&hm=a06730c4e7f5d672e744aa57bb662c34fdc960aab5c1e2f826a83967ef8659a8&","🔥 (1)"

tequila and mezcal: technically, all tequila is mezcal. mezcal refers to spirits made from the agave plant, while tequila refers to a specific type of mezcal that can only be made from blue Weber agave in five Mexican states

whisky and whiskey: generally comes from the place of origin. as a rule of thumb, whiskey mostly was made in both ireland and usa, while whisky was everywhere from scotland to australia.

champagne. it's only called champagne if the sparkling wine was made in the region of champagne, france. even if made with the same ingredients, anything made outside of champagne can't be called one (thats why cremant exist lol). other name for sparkling wines are prosecco (italy), cava (spain), and sekt (germany and austria)

cognac. every cognac is brandy, but not every brandy is cognac, since cognac can only be produced in cognac region in france. other brandy's also produced with a location-specific name such as jerez (spain), pisco (peru), and slivovitz (balkan region)

fortified wines. port (portugal), sherry (spain), marsala (sicily) and madeira (also portugal) is all fortified wine that commonly mixed with brandy or other spirits.

pinga or cachaca. brazilian liquor that a bit similar to rum. both were made from sugarcane, but rum traditionally was made with molasses instead of raw sugarcane.

so basically, chaos packaging takes familiar products and reimagines their containers in unconventional ways, as we can see at moschino's windex bottle perfume, departed spirit's motor oil vodka, and maison margiela vacuum sealed tshirt. more than a novelty, chaos packaging disrupts the predictable, engaging consumers with designs that evoke curiosity, nostalgia, or humor. i mean, who could predict an unsuspecting windex bottle in your vanity happen to be a perfume, right? me personally, i love chaos packaging. not only because of how silly and unique it is, but also how marketable and shelf appealing it is. like, imagine the story and narrative that you can build about and around the product, and also the social media campaign that you can do to suit the theme of the product, or the packaging itself. i'll say, your product could be mid at best, but a good packaging could elevate the sales even more in my opinion, so now imagine if you have a good product and an iconic packaging to accompany it. it could be legendary tbh.

but to pick what chaos packaging suit your product, i guess it all comes down to the story, practicality and the packaging itself. for stories, u need to know all ideation and concept behind the product and the packaging, why it was shaped like that, or the ads regarding the product itself. for the practicality, is really self-explanatory. the product need to be easy to dispense, enjoy and use. if your chaos packaging didn't allow that, then its a bad packaging after all. and the last thing is the shape of the packaging itself. weird is ok, but i guess some norm need to be used. thats all lmao.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1449298127453425706/image-4.png?ex=69960f50&is=6994bdd0&hm=d61ad7a9f23bd01a4ecc5f5d39b978ebeca41b26d7693187af7310618b559824&",""

so basically islay whisky is a single malt whisky that was made in islay, located at the west of scotland. some says that the irish monks come to the islay in the early 1300. those distilleries also started as farm distilleries in the 1700, retreated to the caves in the islay to avoid alcohol tax, which could be counted as illegal distillery back in the day. a lot of those distillery also located on the coast of islay, to easily ""smuggle"" the whisky. those reason is also why a lot of islay whisky have a hint of seaweed and sea, notably because of the type of water that was used. their wheat and barley also have a heavy, smoky aroma which usually be described as ""medicinal flavor"" by whisky enthusiast. this really differentiate the whisky that was made on the mainland because they have a lighter flavor thanks to the usage of spring water.

now we're talking about lagavulin. lagavulin is both the name of the product and distillery, which produce different whisky ages from 8 years to 30ish years iirc. my usual go to (if the bars have them) is the 16 years old lagavulin. i remember it was 2023, and the batch of that year tasted amazing. i can taste the smokiness and how peat-y the whisky was, and like what islay whisky usually is, have a whiff of the sea (which is very faint and i can only smell it after i finished the glass). overall, it tasted sweet, a bit nutty and vanilla-y, with a fruity, orange aftertaste. i will say, for quite the price back then, it was an experience.

all and all, a lot of these distillery usually create a batch every year, and each year could taste a bit differently, which really added to the overall experience imho. the 2023 batch was good, and im looking forward to try more in the future hehe.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1449706684133015563/lagavulin-16-years-closeup.png?ex=69963a4f&is=6994e8cf&hm=ec3d07e92a51a41bc46ca944f8ab86bde96d86db50dc0d931d78520605df1e7d&",""

JMM was made by jerome mage, a French designer who founded the brand in Los Angeles in 2014. he basically create sunglasses and optics in general, usually made of acetate and other material like titanium and other precious metals. his ""mark"" of brand in his glasses are an arrowhead at the temple, a nod to americana style that infatuated jacques. One of the unique features of JMM frames though is the individual numbering and once-run nature of their releases. Once a specific frame and colorway is done, its not bound to be repeated again. their most famous silhouette is probably the Dealan, which was inspired by bob dylan and also, one of my favorite article from the brand. the shape of the article is timeless, and classy in my opinion, which i adore very much. other article that i also like is the enzo and molino as well. but yknow, the shape of their glasses are pretty unique in general.

other than the hefty price and the material used in the making, their presentation of the product is also very exquisite. the use of beautiful silk presentation box is on par with what you’d get from a watchmaker like rolex, and includes a wonderful Italian-leather sleeve and cleaning cloth, plus myriad story details about your frame. it’s really unlike anything you’ve seen in optics, and also differentiate itself from a lot of high end brands like wayfarer and tom ford.

all and all, JMM is actually a good option if ur looking for a luxury glasses brand that offer uniqueness in every articles and also have value in the craftmanship itself. i mean its a valid glasses but the price is... still better than tom ford lol","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450031655791362189/image.png?ex=69961777&is=6994c5f7&hm=2a26495c22956b2470b7d9690aec78784c8661b4e45e4967bb7a81e131502af8&","🔥 (3)"

so basically, marty supreme is a sport-comedy movie inspired by american table tennis player, Marty Reisman. this movie already premiered at 2025 New York Film Festival on 6 October 2025, but set on released by A24 on 25 December 2025. all i know about the premise of the movie itself is that this is a ping-pong drama set in 1950s new york city where Marty goes to hell and back in pursuit of greatness. while promoting the movie, we saw how Timothée Chalamet wearing his in character costume, where he's rocking the buzz cut, wearing a frameless glasses, and also the Marty Supreme tracksuit, which is the main point of this discussion.

the tracksuit itself was designed by Doni Nahmias, the founder and designer of the luxury brand Nahmias. he was basically collaborating this capsule with Chalamet, Taylor McNeill (Chalamet's stylist), and A24. this drop was crazy, since Chalamet only post the drop on his insta with the store address and captioned ""C U at 7"", and people already lining up as early as 4:30. GQ calling this capsule ""The signature garment of 2025 that's not even from YSL or Miu Miu, but relatively affordable, albeit extremely scarce"". Nahmias himself also reportedly said ""this is crazy"" several times during the drop. the $250 tracksuit was sold out at the end of the day and some people already selling the drop for $4.000 on Grailed. today, the same tracksuit (the blue colorway) was selling for $1.797 on StockX, which solidifies their status as a new cultural status symbol. personally i love this jacket. this capsule reminds me of those 2015 thrift jacket era where people deliberately","",""

i will say the marketing made by Chalamet is crazy good, and people was hooked, line and sinker with this ""movie merch"" eventho the film itself hasn't hit the theater. I've seen various meme fashion page where they said that the 2026 NYC male on soho gonna be people wearing those Marty Supreme fits while rocking matching orange arc'teryx beanie, drinking natty light, and ordering small plates on wine bars. I also remember how they're flying out the Marty Supreme orange blimp all across South California, Chalamet videos where he said that he's proposing the idea of painting the Statue of Liberty orange and Chalamet posting picture of celebrities like Tom Brady, Kylie Jenner, and Bill nye wearing the Marty Supreme Threads. it was amazing how he was ""all in"" with this promotion (probably because he's the co-producer but idk) and how invested people with this marketing. about the marketing itself, Nahmias also involved with the making of the lookbook. he even said that going ""rogue"" was the main idea of the promotion, and he's focusing on showing ""greatness"" through vintage sportswear and GOATs of sports.

all and all, Nahmias also said that there are tons of colorways for the tracksuit, so hopefully people can cop the rarer silhouette like pink and baby blue. my take on this discussion is that they need to create more merch tour so that it could be accessible to a wider audience, and Chalamet, i know that i didn't know u personally, but i love how you could bag a LA baddie, make her support the NY Knicks, create a huge buzz all around your upcoming movies, and also tap in to WWE cultures. you're really is, the Lisan al-Ghaib.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450390344507326578/image.png?ex=69961405&is=6994c285&hm=38bbaa53bc8939f13b251a8bee5cdaa406de1f9ce687f4e172a6831323409bb2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450390344892944405/image.png?ex=69961405&is=6994c285&hm=d7540f50d977bbb365559ef27e1a0a12cd2e96bc2ef72a46e545e1fef5b1766d&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450390345321025536/image.png?ex=69961405&is=6994c285&hm=e252272af76376a3a7b672964278a1ed715fdb0790375cce4563abbdcd085b52&",""

inside, i was surprised to know that it was a clothing store (bcs i have no idea before) and immediately i saw a lot of hoodies and shirt (and also try on some) before actually choose to buy the hoodie. the hoodie design was.... minimalistic imho. i pick the item that was supposedly made for their Tokyo collection, which is why they have a big dragon graphic on the back. the hoodie itself was very comfortable and thick. i guess it was suppose to be a winter hoodie, but i do still wear it in Jakarta lol. i feel like, this particular hoodie was shaped really well, and it do fits properly for me. all i know is that this isn't something i can lend to my (future) gf if she was feeling cold lmao

but after i bought one of their hoodie, i want to search this brand, which at the end i didn't really find anything. on their website, they only tell u that ""As a crew who originated in Paris, we proudly wear our 'Located in Paris' identity and share our lifestyle and culture through quality products. Our graphics are inspired by our travels to New York City, Tokyo and Los Angeles, where we set up pop-up stores, collaborations and wholesales with local artists and entities."", which is really something. no designer name, no owner, no nothing. i feel like i just bought a secret street wear from France or something lol. but all i know about this brand is that their hoodie is good, i like the design, and please don't steal mine lol.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450732073970303019/IMG_1480.jpg?ex=699600c7&is=6994af47&hm=64376d6871bcbe41f888ee36162e3c37c2750a88e7e1874aba4769e66f351b86&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1450732074351857727/IMG_1481.jpg?ex=699600c7&is=6994af47&hm=fa175b3c07deb501f75c86213f37d2f13eaf013fc99054d28fb6b669ccfeef5c&","🔥 (1)"

so basically, swag gaps is when a couple has a different ""swag"" or preference of clothing and fashion. it could also means that one of them might be less fashionable, or appear not to make as much of an effort with how they look. one of the most prominent example of swag gaps is Justin and Hailey Bieber, where we can see how Justin was usually can be seen wearing hoodies and crocs, while Hailey is usually wearing more ""refined"" outfits. debates about swag gaps sparks in social medias like TikTok and Instagram, left people actually in the middle whether different swag or efforts are really a big of a deal, or if both parties need to make an effort in their fashion game. some people even go so far as making it a ""dealbreaker"" if their partner actually have different swag or just wearing ""plain"" clothes.

i think having different style is okay. think of it as ""the nerd bagging the cheerleader"" type of thing. i only said this bcs i'm in no position to call anyone fashion as mid. i always the type to let u know that u gotta wear anything comfortable for you, without the need to seek validation or riding the trend lol. if its good, comfy, and practical for u, then rock that shit. u don't need anyone to tell u that it isn't swaggy or anything, as long as ur comfortable in ur own skin. other thing i wanna highlight is that the composition of drip or swag itself. if you know the ""rick owens outfit"" meme and the ""i wore vintage issey miyake while she wore $5 dress from shein"" meme, you know what i mean. drip couldn't be counted from the tag, the price, the brand, or anything else. you make the drip. you make yourself comfortable. you make yourself seen because you define what you wear, and NEVER the other way around.

so yeah... more discussion about swag gaps just lemme know ok?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1451127101158723584/image.png?ex=69961f2d&is=6994cdad&hm=52c8d811d049163278e92bbe9b9cf355bd6e25f007152166f47f2fcab1da1768&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1451127102429728902/image.png?ex=69961f2d&is=6994cdad&hm=403c644759b3764b3463b57d36d5dd5434d0468fd95d200bdebf274a8bc5dbf1&","shock (1)"

but back to the literature. i read a lot of books that makes me realize that every cocktails are great, because a lot of them could be made out of different liquor, different technique, and also different ""finesse"". if u told me back in 2015 that different amount of stirs and duration of shake could affect the taste and consistency of cocktails, i actually will laugh at you, because the younger me would never comprehend such ridiculous and trivial things like that, but apparently those things do affect those factors lol. even bartending also have different styles. you have your typical, poised, old school bartender, flashy, captivating flair bartender, or avant-garde molecular mixologist. but you know what they said, different types means different opportunities to try them all.

all and all, i will say that i do enjoy cocktails and whisk(e)ys. and for some recommendations if you want to read more about cocktails and bartending, i suggest you to read Jerry Thomas' bartender guide, bartender (manga), and to have and have another by philip greene. enjoy!","","❤️ (1)"

basically, this style of aesthetic originated from the 12th-16th centuries in europe, where the architectural design popularize the sharp, pointy, intricate details. this trend influence the style of the jewelry with the intricate design, dramatic color contrast, and symbolic motifs that often used to represent love, god and eternity. a lot of gothic jewelry also worn by the wealthy and clergy, used in religious context as a symbol of faith and power. thats why back then, a lot of people were using gothic crosses for praying purposes as well. but in the 20th century, we also see the rise of gothic subculture, where the jewelry are used as a form of self-expressions. the dark and mysterious image of the jewelry becoming the cornerstone of that era, where they change the way they see the jewelry to something that portray death, romanticism, and supernatural. punk and metal also heavily influenced by the gothic jewelry, where we can see bands and musicians like","","❤️ (3)"

all and all, i think gothic jewelry is always great, since people are always trying to combine something really close to their heart (like religion and love) but with more drip and style. gothic jewelry kinda nailed it, and i guess the era of gothic jewelry will never pass and people are still gonna wear it one way or another. me personally? i don't own any of those chrome hearts but maybe in 2026 👀","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1452532072768999466/image.png?ex=6995f5a8&is=6994a428&hm=f63fe9d53f908428499bf6de39fa0342d6253b20f41a58a46f53426a1b3c56c5&",""

basically, HMDD is a brand based in LA. this brand was started by brothers Jack and Jyde Manson back in 2019, but according to them, they only really started to get serious on this brand in 2023. looking at the brand, i guess they're inspired from other brands like adidas, denim tears, and evisu, which u can really see the inspirations in some of their articles. what i love about this brand is a lot of things, but to start it, is the way they design their drops. i feel like, sometimes streetwear can be too much and/or trying too hard to create something that looks ""hard"" and ""tuff"", which ultimately failed and just looking like an eyesore tbh. with HMDD, they keep it simple, but with a good executions. their jorts? good. their sweatpants? good. their shirts and hoodies? also good. even their dirt bike inspired shirt and jackets are flawlessly good without incorporating way too much design and brandings.

next thing that i like is how they love to play with proportions. they have boxy hoodie, a slightly baggy sweatpants, oversized hoodie, and also fitted shirt that just shows the range of the fits that they offer. and the last thing is that how they're not afraid to use various colors on their pieces. from blood orange hoodie to white and purple sweatpants, they really got it. sometimes, black, grey , white, and other monochrome colors feels a tad too ""safe"" yknow? but HMDD really understand how to combine those colors without making it too much.

i guess that's all for now lol, and here are some of my favorite articles from HMDD. lemme know if u want me to talk about other brands ok?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1452892155407499344/image.png?ex=6995f383&is=6994a203&hm=dc2ba8abcc700020ec6f4c8e2a0037045d8b8864e7c83c81205b52df6f8f4c85&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1452892155805696113/image.png?ex=6995f383&is=6994a203&hm=f6cb00dd55c757640d323766819136b11ddedbd63cea2114f5516c97a5398c45&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1452892156120272896/image.png?ex=6995f383&is=6994a203&hm=e8489e39a23861e110100dcf7bad8128c80708b604c73b10e9991220044a496b&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1452892156518993971/image.png?ex=6995f383&is=6994a203&hm=e17d61da146acf38bf56b82b29f5d4fb973984410e2857870e18109fd7f301ae&","pray (1)"

Out is a manga written by Tatsuya Iguchi and illustrated by Makoto Mizuta. Tatsuya was inspired by a novel called ""DROP"" by Hiroshi Shinagawa and also his own experience when he was entangled with a motorcycle club in chiba. the manga itself tells a story about 17-year-old Iguchi Tatsuya that has been released from juvenile detention and trying to get away from the bad influence of his old friends, but he's still find himself in trouble and having a tendencies to violence as well. all and all, your typical school fighting manga like clover and crows.

""so, what's the correlation between the manga and CH?"" glad that u asked. if u take a look at the cover of the manga, you can see the character of the manga itself was rocking chrome all over their body. their cover arts is basically a lookbook fr. they really feature some of the classic silhouettes like filigree cross, keeper ring, and even the Rolex sub with roller bracelet. the amount of details and accessories everyone use in 1 cover is also crazy. they stack it like Wisdom Kaye's Instagram content, while existing since 2012. they way they draw it is also aesthetically pleasing. they really draw it like its just another details. it feels like they do really rocking the brand and fit the aesthetic, not only wearing it for the drip.

all and all, go check out the manga. its pretty good and i actually just discover this manga like couple days ago. so... have fun!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1453744355407040674/250px-Out_manga_volume_1_cover.png?ex=69966a2f&is=699518af&hm=ab1bc11a50f5edff2ea9219c1b9c56e7e4fdbc776ef19c43ac68e0143bf50665&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1453744355738386516/image.png?ex=69966a2f&is=699518af&hm=bd4a3bd70657d8626ffc4364fa2b97a83b59fccc1910ddca34609fb40e13b461&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1453744356094644285/image.png?ex=69966a2f&is=699518af&hm=0513187013252ba2a5ef96d184e116d7eca18dca9fe49ec06fc6dcb5229ac6f1&",""

I KNOWWW how the public may love this brand whatever they do, but just for a minute, take a look at this monstrosity and lemme know what u think aight.

so this one is a collaboration between chrome hearts, nocta, and nike. they basically create a puffer jacket and others like crewneck and t-shirts. the collaboration itself is pretty wild, since nocta has been moving crazy in 2025. they literally do collaborations with everyone at this point, ranging from SP5DER, Venezia FC, CODE 05, and now, chrome hearts. this collab works suppose to be a big and amazing things, since drake himself has been hinting on the works and also hyping it up, telling us that this is his biggest fashion collab of 2025. but what i see from the release? an actual garbage. a failed attempt to utilize a popular and high demand silhouette tbh.

i know that something like a realtree or hunting camouflage has been popular for the past few weeks. i know that this is basically 3 huge brands colliding. i also realize that this could be something popular in 2026, but tbh with you, i don't fw it. i hate it. it's ugly. like, when they're trying to incorporate the chrome cross on the pattern, it looks hideous for me. the overall silhouette is also not really helping. the silver zip is too small to be a main point of the design, and the puffer is also a normal nike puffer. i don't think i can justify the $39.000 price tag for this one fr. i feel like, they're trying too hard. they're combining things that don't really belong to one another and just ended up creating a failure imho. i usually love the realtree graphic hat and tees, but this one is garbage fr. i dunno how to defend it tbh lol

all and all, i will say that PROBABLY, this goes hard for someone, but not me. if me in 2025 hate this collab, let's see in 10 years if i yearn for this product, bcs i know some people that suddenly fw supreme box hoodie in '25","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1454101265859477637/image.png?ex=69966515&is=69951395&hm=2764bb8e548d67c241cbb59e685f33e6da7ab2521f190a39a8f51853b1b584e7&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1454101266492821626/image.png?ex=69966515&is=69951395&hm=c98f1428d371a70fba2f68bc0157d05cd8f921cebca22cc022ab4a66ec39a1a2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1454101267457773580/image.png?ex=69966516&is=69951396&hm=cfa334c98b2768439294b78cc6180ec518603da4f391e5b3c69e21f6670705dc&",""

so, patina is a natural, gradual surface change on materials like metal, wood, or leather, resulting from aging, use, and exposure to elements that creates a unique sheen, color shift, motifs, and texture. people love patina because it tells a story of how long did someone wear that specific piece of clothing, and how long does it takes to ""create"" one. some of the more common patinas in fashion cultures are honeycomb jeans, faded fabrics, matured raw leathers, and worn-down clothes. people love patina so much, they create an idea called ""trompe l'oeil"", where they create fake stains age and wear on their freshly made clothes, eventho its very different from a ""true"" patina where it can only shown after years of usage.

me personally, i love to create patina. i've done so many things from maturing my leather wallet, ripping my old jeans, sea wash raw denims, putting coins on my pocket and brush it using a nail file, dropping cigs ashes on my hoodie, and so on lmao. i will say, i do enjoy waiting for it, taking care of the products, and also trying to faster things up bcs i'm impatient like that. but truly, the experience of creating your patina is amazing and also unique for me, bcs the idea of wearing the same pants for years just to create a honeycomb on my calves and have your phones marked in your pants is just cool. i think personally, patina is always great, and it does tells a lot of stories, especially if you love that 1 clothing piece like that.

all and all, i do recommend you guys to create your own patinas on your fashion items. if you're impatient like me, either google how to create the fade and marks, or buy that $550 carhartt jacket from your local vintage store lol","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1455060674156953610/image.png?ex=6995ee1a&is=69949c9a&hm=ac72212b419ccfca0303fe377dbfbf05bea2c91c2f5495af06da4767c32e7fd2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1455060674924253194/6ogxwxe9nat51.png?ex=6995ee1a&is=69949c9a&hm=02d6c525a7e940c35b51f28ec6145fef21fc7160508f2997b58db6980be390b0&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1455060675780022466/image.png?ex=6995ee1a&is=69949c9a&hm=32dbc2b70af0d564f94aa2375a7964856449749011631e9c1e97bb4da8c18057&","❤️ (1),noted (1)"

basically, international date line (IDL)  is an imaginary line, mostly along the 180° longitude in the pacific ocean, that separates one calendar day from the next, essentially marking where a new day begins (westward) and an old one ends (eastward). crossing it westward adds a day (you go back in time, sort of), while crossing eastward subtracts a day (moving forward in time), helping reconcile global time zones. we need the IDL to prevent global time chaos, acting as the 24-hour boundary where a new calendar day begins and ends, allowing for consistent time zones as the earth rotates.

my main issue with IDL is that, it's not a straight line. its full of zigs and zags, and it just didn't really make any sense to me. basically, IDL isn't straight to avoid splitting countries, islands, and territories, preventing major confusion where one side of a community could be a day ahead of the other. IDL basically splitting earth into two like the equator, but because some countries are PUSSIES that didn't want to be confused with different calendar days, WE HAVE CORNERS IN OUR IDL. i hate it bcs SOME COUNTRIES like SAMOA and ALEUTIAN ISLANDS are being a COWARD and really said ""boo hoo pls dont let our SMALL islands hv different dates uwu :3"" all i see is countries being a LOSER that just really thinks that THEY'RE IMPORTANTS (they are, sometimes). YOUR BIGGEST EXPOSURE IS THE .tv WEB EXTENTION (yes i'm talking to u, tuvalu) and MUN KIDS REPPING YOUR COUNTRIES BCS THEY LITERALLY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPTIONS.

all and all, IDL is important and very helpful towards our live, but can we agree to pray that KIRIBATI, TONGA, SAMOA, and FIJI to SINK FASTER so that we can have a straight IDL? thank you so much this has been lotso's TedTalk","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1455395165748334756/what-happens-to-the-international-date-line-by-kiribati-if-v0-037ilhxdd1ff1.png?ex=69967cdf&is=69952b5f&hm=ca721b467f6d31459abbb0e185f34f96e099dd84a0b3dc1073628fdabeb5cf84&","😭 (1)"

Dior died of a heart attack back in october 24th, 1957 in montecatini, italy. it was a sudden news for everyone since he was on vacation that day. some reports said that he was dead while choking on a fish bone, others said that he died of heart attack after playing cards. YSL, who was his protégé at that moment, basically was mourning his teacher when the picture was taken. it wasn't a ""marketing campaign"" or a ""symbol of the future"", it was all sadness. YSL also stated his admirations towards his mentor, and how he can't be a couturier if not because of dior himself. really, a national event.

after i've done my research, i feel like this photo is actually more powerful than i ever imagine. YSL basically was informed in the middle of the ceremony that he'll be the successor of christian dior, and the artistic director of the haute couture house at only 21 years old. that was some HEAVY burden to begin with. think of it as a CEO, or a leader of the WHOLE fashion genre at such tender age. not only that, YSL also need to carry dior's name through the highest critics from fashion journalists such as vogues and harper's bazaar which at that time, was a very huge deal to begin with (still to this day ofc). but dior maybe knows more than anyone, since he also highly praise YSL since he was 18 years old. dior actually said that ""*Yves Saint Laurent is young, but he is an immense talent. In my last collection, I consider him to be the father of thirty-four out of the 180 designs. I think the time has come to reveal it to the press. My prestige won’t suffer from it*"" which is the","","⭐ (2),👍 (2)"

all and all, all i can say is that i love this photo since the first time i saw it back in middle school. i do used to think that it was only a random dude with a weird name, mourning the death of some other dude in a cool way. i guess every photos have some importance in them huh. one more thing tho, christian dior's next collection in 1958 was a huge success. YSL receive a standing ovation, and all the press' that was attending the show was left amazed and ""in a state of euphoria"" according to the Musée Yves Saint Laurent Paris. they were attempting to immortalize the debut of the “little prince of fashion,” while groups of admirers wept with joy.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1455814246544969819/j2oyrrxb10g71.png?ex=699608ec&is=6994b76c&hm=5005a3aa2e8e6b4f7eafa24aaee1eadae97cef65eccd21be5c99f154fcb3da6a&",""

The ""kpopification"" of a fandom is the adoption of K-pop's unique and highly organized fan  culture, aesthetics, and interaction models by fans of non-K-pop entities. basically, this is how trends like fan projects, usage of slangs (trainee, maknae, and bias), fancams & edits, merchandises such as photocards, and community identities were emerged inside of the fandoms. some people love it, and some people hate it. i remembered reading some arguments from a valorant champions called zeek, where he said that the trend is detrimental to the competitive integrity and cultures of the game itself, linking to toxic and overly parasocial behaviors that they feel detract from the game itself. some people also argue with the growing numbers of female fans in F1, which used to be a male dominated sport for a long time. they said that kpopifications kinda ruin the sport that they love. they argued that the sport has shifted from the strategy and technical aspects to the luxury and drama side of the sport, which was unimportant before. i will say, i've seen some FOMO F1 fans that only follow certain teams and being toxic to the fans of other teams, which was really makes no sense and wasn't happened before (i think).

personally, i guess kpopification in fandoms are okay. both are industries that trying to create more money, and also trying to be more relevant each and every day. if anything, kpop fans do know how to create buzz and traction towards their idols, while the og fandoms can also always focus on the sports or anything that they love, without bothering one another.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1457613402221449410/image.png?ex=6995fd04&is=6994ab84&hm=7b9cba283b16076cbbce415f2715899800c50c95e5c4dc23f038cee663dcb77d&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1457613402552795273/the-kpopification-of-vct-a-debate-v0-gt1qruyrmgle1.png?ex=6995fd04&is=6994ab84&hm=edf424ea08a041c0f363a2f7047dc1328bcccdebcb8565d1517688a1672e3437&","😮 (1)"

Nanamin is a former member of Nogizaka46. she was active in 2011 and graduated in 2017. after graduating, she retired from entertainment industries, study spatial design in tokyo, and now working at sony music entertainment as a music video producer. her career history is nothing out of the ordinary, i guess. a lot of idols that graduated do retired from the industry altogether, but what make her special is why she choose to be an idol from the first place. she admit that she started to be an idol because she wants to pay her parents debt. even as an idol, she still juggles multiple part-time and university works. she even considering graduate early to apply as a civil servant or lawyer just because she needs more money. at one of her show, she admit that at her house, ""Gas, water, and electricity were cut off on a daily basis due to nonpayment of bills."" and that was her main goal of being an idol at the first place. after six years with the group, she announced her graduation simply because she repaid all of her parents debt already. it was a teary announcement as well since her parents was sending her a letter contains their regret of making her working that hard and always pushing herself, and how she basically turn their lives around to the better. her brother also make an appearance and saying that he's proud of his sister and how he's eligible for an academic scholarship because her sister always supported his dream and never let the electricity out. i swear to you, i actually shed a manly tears watching all of that graduation concert.

all and all, her story is one for the book, because she is very resilient and hard-working that ur actually respect her grind. so goodluck, nanamin. keep enjoying murakami's works and shine brighter than anyone else.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1457927812236443862/Nogizaka46_at_Japan_Expo_2014_28629.png?ex=69967915&is=69952795&hm=a95f23c07d00bb5dfbefea0be9877f5dd55c56b83ed31da9c5e9e25d1aed3948&","❤️ (2)"

when i first saw this, i thought that this is a newly made idea that turned out to be cool. it was the vinyl for the soundtrack of the movie ""saltburn"" that makes me aware to such style of vinyl. i thought this was a new invention, but that wasn't the case. in fact, disney thought of it first back in 1978, but it was failed because there's a leakage and sealing issues that makes them prevented the release. the early method of liquid filled vinyl was to glue record halves with a spacer after filling the gap with a colored liquid. this leads to inconsistencies, leakage, evaporation, and poor sound quality due to the non-standard construction.

in the modern era, people finally crack how to create a more durable way to seal liquid filled vinyl. basically what they do is to swap the liquid inside of the vinyl to this oily, sticky liquid that kinda looks like a slime. they did this to prevent wet leakage and evaporation of the liquid itself. after that, they use special resin and airtight seals to improve the sealings of the halves, making sure that the vinyl itself have a better overall qualities, playable with a better sound, and also longer storage life so that stores and collectors didn't have to worry. after the improvements, people started to go crazy with the theme of the liquid itself. some bands mixed their blood into the vinyl, some mixing sands and hairs into theirs, and saltburn...... yeah i have no comment on saltburn's vinyl liquid lmao.

all and all, this is a very cool inventions imho. some collectors do argue that this type of vinyl is only a marketing gimmick since they have less audio quality, higher cost to make, and only serve a purpose of being a display, which i kinda agree","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1458322734692958238/s-l500.png?ex=6995eea2&is=69949d22&hm=c91a1551d1f9277a3214a28e80265c1f2ae88f5fc7152c3730d510aa4dc75b1d&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1458322735074902037/image.png?ex=6995eea2&is=69949d22&hm=1da09ea3cbc428a5a89ab6e31f30ca615015c0ae131343f7ed14caea4978645c&",""

- Bred: Any Air Jordan in the basic Chicago Bulls black and red colorway. used to be banned because back then NBA only allowed white shoes

- Black/white Cement: The black/white-speckled grey paneling that was found as an accent. originated in air jordan 4, but the air jordan 3 version of it shows something like a ""crack"" on some panels.

- Chicago: almost like the bred colorway, but with a touch of white in the midbody and midsole

- Pollen: black and yellow colorway, inspired by bees

- Shattered Backboard: inspired by a famous moment in 1985 when Michael Jordan shattered a backboard with a dunk during a Nike exhibition game in Italy. black and orange colorway

- UNC: short for University of North Carolina, which is MJ's alma mater. they use baby blue and white colorway inspired by the color of the UNC's jersey

- Concord: Refers to the 'White/Black/Dark Concord' colorway of the Air Jordan 11

- Cool grey: characterized by a mostly medium grey upper with white accents

- Shadow: almost like cool grey, but with darker grey and black colorway

- Flu Game: exclusively air jordan 12 with bred colorway. famous because MJ played in this shoe while having food poisoning

- Georgetown: navy and gray colorway inspired by MJ’s famed game winner against the school in the 1982 NCAA Championship

- Royal: royal blue and black colorway, which apparently MJ's favorite color combination

- LA to Chicago: mostly purple and gold, that wears out to chicago colorway once it aged and scuffed.

that's (probably) all the colorways that i know with their original stories as well. it's still an incomplete list ofc, so lemme know if u know more alright?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1458689167193018453/image.png?ex=6995f266&is=6994a0e6&hm=d6442dc9d92ba063c4c732db2ce8fe5a8436f5dbfdd2aabbc61453892654d6d2&",""

Badly in Love is a japanese dating shows filled with group of men and women with checkered pasts living in an old school building for two weeks; at the end of that time, they have to declare their love for one of their housemates. im talking about ex yakuza, club owner, hostess, and biker gang leader participating in a dating show (yes their pasts is real) and just really trying to build a relationship lol. i remember watching just the first 2 minutes of the first episodes and 2 of the contestants are already fighting. they even have securities and bodyguards in the shows to protect their casts from fights and anything else, which is crazy. if you knew dating shows like terrace house, single's inferno, or love island, this was very different from it. i feel like, they're being very honest about themselves. they speak bluntly about attraction, irritation and insecurity, skipping the sugarcoating common to the genre, which really shows the rawness and genuineness of their feelings as well to the viewers. they also have strict rules like no physical violence and no illegal activities, which if broken could basically send them home lol. other things that i love about this series is also how the contestants, with their turbulent pasts and all, reveal unexpected depth as they open up about trauma, regret and attempts to change course, which i kinda get. idk why, but i love how genuine they was, how earnest every confessions feels like, and also how emotional some people could be. i really enjoy this series i guess lol.

all and all, i think this is one of the better dating show that u can watch next time, and it's very enjoyable as well. lemme know if u also enjoy it or want to discuss this topic even more aight?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1459022156531765259/MV5BNDBiOTAxYmQtYjRiNC00ZTQ2LWEyMjAtN2Y0YWJjOTk0OWJiXkEyXkFqcGc.png?ex=69967fc5&is=69952e45&hm=804381504563e2a810b36ecb714127914528ebde734749d7fb41f2e3f82a99f7&","❤️ (1)"

in retrospect, 2016 wasn't all about it. see, you think Kanye's ""the life of pablo"" capsule was great? do you think that supreme box hoodie was amazing? do you think that wearing a choker and ankle boots was great? i dunno about that buddy. oh, Dries Van Noten was releasing a bomber jacket? AGAIN? wow so creative wow so real! VLONE tees and off white yellow belt? wow much color sign me up i guess. Vetements DHL tees? meh. but that's enough about fashion, and let's see other trends in 2016 such as ""WORK"" by Rihanna, ""LEAN ON"" by Major Lazer, ""ROSES"" by The Chainsmoker, ""HOTLINE BLING"" by Drake, like, that's some repetitive ahh music and also, a BORING one. yes i said it. a boring one. we also can't forget other things like snapchat dog filter, Instagram's Valencia and Clarendon filters, #swag on every post, Conjuring and Deadpool was reigning supreme at cinemas like, what's up with all of those??? that's so cringe i actually can't lmao.

i guess, 2016 wasn't all bad. yes i do kinda missed those years in my life, and yes i still crave those yeezy 900 and nike more uptempo, and yes i do still love to listen to calvin harris, but idk.... i think cringing towards the past is not that bad.... and i think i was accidentally listing all of my favorite things in 2016 so..... yeah..... hehe","",""

when i look it up, apparently, i was leaning towards type B personality, which usually generalized as an easy-going, relaxed person. they said that type b people kinda mess their workplace or comfortable places because it's where their creativity really running on. they said that it was because they're really focused with something in front of them, and not really bothered with their surroundings, making their spaces feels cramped and untidy. honestly, i can see that, because all i need is to make sure that my keyboard and screen wasnt covered with anything and im gucci like that. i dont care if i havent put my albums in the wardrobe, or whether my xy kidz magazine was on the floor, as long as my laptop and/or pc wasnt getting disturbed lol. i know this isnt the best thing to discover, but yeah it kinda happened.

all and all, while writing this ramble,  i also tidying up my space, and i must say, not a bad job from me tbh. i managed to actually put everything where they belong, and also feel a bit accomplished that i managed to actually keep my shit together as i was working lol. i do hope that i can continue this positive trends and actually clean up my desk better, and hope u guys also get inspired to clean ur rooms as well.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1462691347969347708/IMG20260119131205.jpg?ex=69960138&is=6994afb8&hm=26df323d6c897fc8f049d8fefe756f331ad01195c8a7612f333ea02d85a42600&","🔥 (6),❤️ (2)"

so if u didnt know who oguri cap is, she's one of the real horse race in japan, and also a chara from uma musume: pretty derby. she can be characterized by diamond tiara on her head, short white hair, and also gluttony behavior. in the anime, she often be seen chomping huge amount of foods and also constantly hungry, which really explains why i love this trend of cosplay.

basically, i was surfing on the internet when i saw the oguri cap ordering from burger king drive thru cosplay. at first i was, cackled by how on theme the cosplay was, and also how seemingly ""effortless"" they look. aside from the intricate wigs and school uniform, i feel like, this oguri cap cosplay is one of my favorite thing to see, because of all the things that really make the scene. after that one drive thru cosplay, i also saw a lot of them posing in front of the burger king, eating the whopper, rocking the paper crown, and also just vibing, really capturing the essence of the character. i know that a lot of cosplayers also goes thru lengths to create realistic cosplays such as climbing a mountain and doing photoshoot at the beach, but this one is different for me. burger king, unlike other spots, are kinda everywhere, and spotting one wouldn't be so difficult imho. its just really shows that u know your chara really well, and you execute the photoshoot perfectly eventho it's just probably a block or two from your house. burger king and oguri cap is a combination that i kinda associate together with, and i guess any more oguri cap cosplays wouldn't be complete without the signature burger and paper crown i'm afraid.

all and all, i really enjoy watching and looking at those oguri cap cosplayers, and i'd like to see more goofy uma musume cosplay from now on. and yes, i support uma musume cosplay at the broncos' games lol","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1463080556215668789/image.png?ex=69961a33&is=6994c8b3&hm=a77573a89fb0da7cc3a919095e8bed0ec91dde360a6e01e78afbc29cbd4320c8&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1463080556974702592/image.png?ex=69961a33&is=6994c8b3&hm=21f2f1f8e513b6df3e3291d676f9ea450b9235b6562e611754ee86187c883b95&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1463080557662441473/image.png?ex=69961a33&is=6994c8b3&hm=303ca997862eaa7e03f41bf7d6861e6b317b373dd89e1a56f7fce4e220b0962b&","❤️ (1)"

"691626449743904810","lotso125","2026-01-23T07:59:04.0960000+00:00","i like whimsical luxury items that really have little to no purposes (beside their actual purposes) and i'd like to talk about it today.

basically what i mean with whimsical items was some ""useless"", cheaper items that u buy because u need to build relationship with the brands. for example, before you can buy Audemars Piguet's (AP) Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, u need to buy other, cheaper watches from AP so that you can be ""trusted"" by the brand to buy their more luxury, expensive, rare, and sought after products, like the royal oak. for other brands like Hermes, you can't immediately buy the Kelly or the Birkin bags, instead you can get yourself other bags, ties, even some stationaries from them. in AP's case, cheaper watches are still a good product, is just that you can't buy some of the rarer APs, but in Hermes' case, why the hell would you need a, orange colored pencil case with a horse logo? but people still did this, because ✨ Birkins ✨. ~~eventho you can always buy secondhand birkins from consignment stores just don't forget to legit check them tho~~

but tbh, some of those whimsical items were also really cool and i'd love to get my hands on them. like those pencils are cool. YSL lomo camera is cool. Chrome Hearts' sauce bottles are cool. even things that are too whimsical like Supreme's Brick and crowbars are cool. idk why, but i do fell in love with them. it's just too goofy to pass on to. i feel like, i can show it off to my friends that ""yes i do own some avant garde, high-fashion, luxury items as well"" while they're wondering whether it's gonna be a 3-piece suit from Prada or just some Chrystal Chess Set from Baccarat. it's just cool, y'know? and yeah i do understand that i might be senseless or anything but to own something so silly like this to decorate my own space is just like a funny dreams to chase after lol.

all and all, that's what i think about whimsical, luxury items. please share more goofy things from your favorite luxury brands!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1464167537477550232/pencil-gift-set-limited-edition--606610V0-front-wm-1-0-0-800-800_g.png?ex=69961a07&is=6994c887&hm=2acad44b84e3a5ada7900d05970cc871e9a746ccd6504acf5c57beae9e4511ca&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1464167537926475867/https3A2F2Fhypebeast.com2Fimage2F20212F072Fchrome-hearts-bbq-grill-tools-collection-01.png?ex=69961a07&is=6994c887&hm=19b96ad8ba5bfa17ff4abedce829962caeace237fe03a22cedb2fc4ccad1b419&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1464167538228203686/image.png?ex=69961a08&is=6994c888&hm=284c9b87f93644abe7354b83e177b093102916defabc1e839513b8f8ee1b4d88&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1464167538526130342/image.png?ex=69961a08&is=6994c888&hm=fd1b4bf2a1330b3c35babb7a631ef87d05aef1447e4b51206d5ef804ba623270&","👍 (1)"

so i kinda noticed the new logo from their F/W pre collections, which really, also raised a lot of questions from the people. Loewe's logo used to be this 4 mirrored Ls shaped like a square, and now they only consist of a pair of Ls. even those Ls doesn't mean as an L, but as an L and a J, which stands for Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough, their new creative directors. since Jonathan Anderson's departure to DIOR, Loewe is being led by both Lazaro and Jack at the helm. beyond their partnership as a creative directors, apparently they're also a real life couple. whether the resemblance is intentional or coincidental, nobody knows tbh with you. but the ""timing"" and the subtlety of the move make this thought hard to ignore imho. tbh it feels like less like a branding and more like a human signature for me. really marking the change of their directions from the usual, marking of the luxury Spanish brand, to something more intimate, and classy. the old logo itself was designed in 1970s by Spanish artist Vicente Vela, build from 4 mirrored Ls and arranged into a continuous knot. back then, it references the branding irons of leather ateliers and the ornamental language of Spanish crafts.

if you ask me, this isn't something new. luxury brands like YSL and Balmain also experimenting new logos for their brands. what makes Loewe different for me was the way they didn't change the Spanish artistry from their logo to something more minimalistic and boring like what YSL did. they didn't just slap a lousy Montserrat or Times New Roman logo on their brands and called it a day lol. instead they still embrace their Spanish heritage, and just refresh their looks from their logo, just to make it more short and subtle, just like their new collections. overall, i kinda like it, and i can't wait for their big S/S collection reveal that people said ""jaw-dropping"" and ""refreshing"".","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1464919639086858494/Copy-of-Buro-Featured.png?ex=6996337a&is=6994e1fa&hm=a23c677e7aa22ea1787ae8c9c6a9f35fa8dcaa5f76b589995b1dd0419658fd86&",""

if u didn't know, Rocket Bunny is a renowned line of Japanese widebody car kits designed by Kei Miura of TRA Kyoto, known for their aggressive, rivet-style overfenders and, often, retro-inspired aesthetics. if you've been playing games like Forza and NFS, u must know that the widebody trends are first popularized by Rocket Bunny as well and they're heavily influenced by them.

Rocket Bunny has done tons of modifications, but this one is too cute that i can't pass them up. so basically, they modified a Suzuki Twin kei car to make it look like a Skyline GT-R. they custom made and specifically create this small, full body kit that shaped like an R-32 GT-R complete with headlights, exaggerated fender flares, a scaled rear wing and even period-correct 8-spoke wheels and sponsor decals. its shaped like a Japanese model car toy called ""Choro-Q"", hence the nickname and the name of this project. this car made its 1st appearance at Tokyo Auto Salon and quite literally create a huge buzz upon its launch. when the show literally happened, all i can see on my timeline was this car, and to be honest, i love this mods. this works really create something unexpected bcs like, nobody will suspect something small like Suzuki Twin could be modified to something like this. i also love how cute and silly it is. when u hear Rocket Bunny, ur gonna immediately thinking about miatas, RX-7s, silvias, and other JDM staples. i guess Suzuki Twin is still a Japanese car for sure, but yknow... not one of the staple base car and ofc also not something ur gonna expect.

all and all, this car is basically the epitome of Japanese car culture, referencing JDM legend – the R32 GT-R, relatability – kei cars as a staple vehicle option for Japanese commuters, and Pop culture – the ""Choro Q"" nickname and build reference, which is very cool imho.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1466669771973198046/photo.png?ex=6995f9eb&is=6994a86b&hm=96b4d8ef65bfc85c15ca59475d6209e6b72465441b271008bb41fab4681e6b20&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1466669772589764811/photo.png?ex=6995f9eb&is=6994a86b&hm=a156908a266b9a2d8d628d29431328f6de59d9d6e87113c407f833c0d920fb1c&",""

so i've seen Dior's S/S 2026 women collection, and immediately, i saw Anderson's way of reviving Dior's long lost elegance. in the past years, Dior's collection was a bit, redundant and loud if i'm being honest. Anderson himself calling his wave as something ""radical"", where he also said ""Radical doesn’t have to be loud; radical can sometimes just be about the process of trying to work out what is new, and what is new for Dior is different from what would be new for Loewe.” as someone who used to be Loewe's creative director, this is something a little bit shocking, because he kinda trying to create a distinction where Dior is this ""wasteland"" where he could create his own universe and not being afraid to destroy any tradition unlike his previous workplace.

the difference in design do be very apparent. his take on Dior's newest collection feels like an explosion of creativities where he kinda do what he was limited to where he's in Loewe. i was amazed by his usage of oversize hats, puff skirts, and satin shirts that not only scream elegance, but also chic at the same time. i also love the fact that Anderson use small details to promote the brandings, unlike their previous collections. you can see Dior's tag hidden or written very small on the ornaments like bow and straps, and i can't get enough of those designs. his lady dior campaign also looks good with the emphasis on what and how being a lady is. pushing the narrative of everyone is and could be one.

all and all, i think Anderson will do a good job in Dior, and hopefully he could retain the popularities of the brand itself. i mean he better be lmao.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468094569924132997/image.png?ex=69968b9d&is=69953a1d&hm=166ef93f15ba654a5b247819f668e6b1b3a7b92f68654b0e56d4827ba9f94ecb&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468094570246963266/image.png?ex=69968b9d&is=69953a1d&hm=e43b3fff47b89f4f4e3cb63ef93d82ae1bc5db2daf9b1cabdb72d2aadf7c4269&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468094570595094620/image.png?ex=69968b9d&is=69953a1d&hm=448c8acceb7e5cc64544a7a4f4265f40191efbd66c35559cb589d957a8128e0b&","❤️ (1)"

but for fashion style? sejujurnya the only time i saw people wearing this shoe cuma kalo lagi olahraga, specifically something like running, gym, calisthenics, mountaineering, and others. karena itu, w kebiasa mengasosiasikan sepatu ini sama sport gear kayak kaos bahan jersey, celana running pendek, outdoor gear kayak parka dan safari vest, dll. 

BUT, ga selamanya vibram 5 fingers gabisa di styling yg lain. contih besarnya adalah jennie (yes, jennie from blackpink) rocking the shoes while wearing this type of outfit. jadi sebenernya styling seperti ini pun possible gitu. tp w juga sematkan styling2 lain yg menurut w weirdly fitting dan cakep juga buat cowo. jadi kesimpulannya menurut gue juga depending on the colour, u bisa maksimalin your style juga. all and all, vibram 5 finger is also a type of shoe dan selama styling u cocok dari segi warna, layer, aksesoris dan (yg paling penting) UR CONFIDENT, vibram 5 finger bisa u pake untuk sehari2.

so the 1st one is Lady Arpels Heures Florales Cerisier watch from Van Cleef. this 38mm watch was created with luxury gems such as diamonds, sapphires, and mother pearls and made to resemble a flower on beds of vine. i do aware its functionalities as a watch are a bit confusing, but nonetheless, a cool watch to look at. i mean, the way of telling time with this one is to count the number of open flowers on the dial to determine the hour (1 to 12), while the minutes are displayed via a small window on the side of the case. beauty against practicalities, amirite.

the 2nd watch is actually function more like a normal watch, but it's still one for the book i guess. it is Vacheron Constantin's Heures Créatives Heure Discrète. this one comes from their Heures Créatives collection, which was inspired by the women’s watches developed by the actual Vacheron Constantin during the 1920s, 1930s and 1970s. the inspiration behind the design clearly comes from a fan that commonly used in both european and asian culture, decorated with 18k diamonds and also manual winding for the watch itself. one hell of a watch that's for sure.

all and all, yes i'm aware that this watch were made for women of at least, created with women user in mind, i just feel like, i can't help but to look at it as a piece of beautiful jewelry at the end of the day, i mean, amidst its design, purpose, and practicality, i still love those watches and can see myself actually wearing one on my wrist. sometimes, design for male audiences can be a little... monotonous, boring, lackluster, and dull yknow? and this watch, as feminine as it is, still put me in a chokehold and still makes me begging for it. f those guys that say boys don't deserve cute things. so... yeah that's all. let me know which watches you'd love to have in your life, i guess?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468518189343440988/image.png?ex=69961be4&is=6994ca64&hm=d338fff8c2dd5c2edf86ffee6da2792fc793a8ced0e9818823aacf334b2bda27&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468518189980717187/jewellerymag-ru-2-heure-discrete-ot-vacheron-800x552.png?ex=69961be4&is=6994ca64&hm=02e150d858268d710159ad43057cba42de18fc87b9dd7cebf2c65e9d4e90782c&","🔥 (2),❤️ (2),🌸 (2),CherryBlossom (2),gem_shiny2 (1)"

Jacob & Co. collaborated with G-DRAGON to create the “Bandana Royale,” a one of a kind (get it? lol) jeweled collar weighing 559.3 grams in 18K yellow gold, designed for his Übermensch World Tour and 2025 Melon Music Award. this piece features 209.71 carats of gemstones, anchored by a 5.40-carat Fancy Yellow diamond at the center of a jeweled daisy, and embellished with over 2,000 white diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and multi-colored sapphires. this sculptural piece reinterprets G-DRAGON’s signature bandana styling into an innovative statement of high jewelry, also anchoring the intricate form of a jeweled daisy, a motif synonymous with G-DRAGON’s creative philosophy and brand, PEACEMINUSONE. this collab is not a big surprise tbh with you, since G-DRAGON has been collaborating with Jacob & Co before, creating a PEACEMINUSONE logo jewelry and also The Astronomia Solar G-Dragon watch, solidifying his creative inputs and aspects within the brand. eventho their collab just happened from 2025, we all can see how the brand trust G-DRAGON with his own vision, giving him so much freedom as an artist to basically creates some of the coldest pieces in 2025. 

imho, this is a big milestone in kpop history, because this also opens more possibilities of idols receiving their own collaboration with luxury brands. this used to be a luxury only westerners can enjoy, but G-DRAGON basically making it possible for Korean idols to be involved on creative process of creating their own collabs or line of products for western luxury items. he literally paved the way and no other arguments can say otherwise.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468869928613576786/image.png?ex=699611f9&is=6994c079&hm=ec3eec45e0569750ccc3a646a26d590cab09f6fd950fcdb88890e8531602c022&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468869928928153641/image.png?ex=699611f9&is=6994c079&hm=ab292c284b70255b6ac065990ec7a5b1d8d126fb481afbbef17f368ed4ab74ba&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1468869929250848799/image.png?ex=699611f9&is=6994c079&hm=62679bd4e492493296f6c5eb05b2f145517dcd76b0446162345c733eba45f856&",""

before i talk about the line, let's talk about gimlet. gimlet is a name of a cocktail that traditionally made out of gin and lime cordial. some says that the name gimlet comes from a tool used to drill small holes because the cocktail also cause some ""stinging"" after effect to its drinker, and some also says that it comes from the royal navy. there are also variations of gimlet, such as vodka gimlet and pimmlet.

enough about gimlet, but what is ""it's too early for a gimlet""? just like what i said earlier, this line derives from a novel written by Raymond Chandler. it tells a story of a husband that find out his wife was actually murdered, and a detective trying to solve the case (which is really classic back in the day) (mind you this novel was like, published in the 50s or something). the phrase ""it's too early for a gimlet"" was said by the husband to the detective, signifies their friendship and, later, the haunting memory of their shared moments. the husband said this, because they both agree to drink gimlet to forget everything that happened, and just walk separately. but instead, he said that because as painful as the memories is, he don't want to forget it, wanting to preserve it as another bond that was formed because of his wife's death.

but another usage of ""it's too early for a gimlet"" can commonly be found in Japanese bars, where a lot of senior bartenders and customers tend to use this words to their subordinates or rookie bartender to signifies that they're not ready to mix or make gimlet yet, signaling their lack of bartending experiences. from one interview that i watch (and also from a manga) it was simply a reminder, that bartender need to keep practicing and studying so that they can always be better.

so yeah... thats all i know about it. lemme know if u want more discussions about alcohol (yippeeee)!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1469289016703848480/image.png?ex=699646c7&is=6994f547&hm=1ae2a870181e133493b57df9201ebe541af6919088c0a5bf37c4b832ff7107e6&",""

the first one is Michelin stars. this is probably the most common sign and also the most praised and sought after symbol a restaurant can get. it varies from 1 star to 3 star (yeah Felix of straykids was wrong about this), and each stars also mean different things. basically, restaurants may receive One to Three Michelin stars for the quality of their food based on five criteria: quality of the ingredients used, mastery of flavor and cooking techniques, the personality of the chef in the cuisine, harmony of flavors, and consistency between visits. 1 star means its worth a stop, 2 stars means worth a detour, and 3 stars means worth a journey. other than the 3 categories there's also green star that acknowledge restaurateur that at the forefront of sustainable gastronomy.

the next one is Comfort and Quality, which also being scored by Michelin's journalist. for restaurants, it's symbolized by spoon and fork, while the other one is for accommodations like hotels that symbolized by house and trees. there are 5 levels into this comfortable level, which ranges from quite comfortable, comfortable, very comfortable, top class comfort, and luxury.

there's also Bib Gourmand, which given to friendly establishments that serve good food at moderate prices depending the country and areas. so this one is not like a consolation prize or anything, but it's they way of Michelin praising restaurateurs dedicated to providing authentic dining experiences by way of quality cuisine at affordable prices in approachable and friendly establishments. this award symbolized by the Michelin Man licking it lips.

there are also other symbols such as recommended, notable wine/beer/cocktail list, interesting view, terrace dining, simple shop, and counter dining which really makes it easier for customers to read their guides. that's all i know, and happy eating!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1469970231349739713/image.png?ex=69961e35&is=6994ccb5&hm=b5af3160196284eff2f182dc22c62b8125a00eaf7292b4b77fdbc3ebd665784c&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1469970231936946217/33e5a2c0bd9f4a16829d4ff834bf890f_to-the-stars-and-beyond-restaurants-comfort-and-quality.png?ex=69961e36&is=6994ccb6&hm=d129bf93ed69f1fefc61f617727b412bc856e523fe9498e43112c8f86317bab2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1469970232339857428/EGoULXWKBi8KbmyzBGsApVm5nxn8mHGBbTKBEyoug0jmohFqZxTE9P1gYY6WnNq7KOagP1Pq1KlBSBfpxWUo8ePXr06NGjR48ePXr06NHjnPEfjfY8yuZz8ukAAAAASUVORK5CYII.png?ex=69961e36&is=6994ccb6&hm=5b0e84f8aea2d03e4f6d42f0815191aa8f506ba41b8cc9d5c19de31dca2d4419&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1469970232658366560/image.png?ex=69961e36&is=6994ccb6&hm=26c2eba09e5f465321f645a0be24cbb140aa4edb448339d9cd1a7751c76aa454&",""

I'm gonna talk about the man behind their CD jacket or CD cover designs, which is Yusuke Nakamura.

so Yusuke Nakamura is a Japanese illustrator, manga artist, and musician. he was graduated from the design major of Osaka University of Arts with dreams of working at a game company. after graduated from there, he served as an assistant in his major while actively working as an illustrator. he was working for some time, until he was invited to his first solo exhibitions where he was made public for the first time. around the same year, Masafumi Gotoh from AKFG also contacted him to illustrate their debut album called Hōkai Amplifier, and the rest is history.

what i like about his illustrations is how he used clean lines, flat colors, and also his ""character"" that usually a depiction of a women with this still-faced image that for me, either looks like innocence, or just complete no reaction almost. Nakamura's philosophy for AKFG's cover album while designing their CD jacket was to explaining the feelings of the songs in the album subtly, hence the still face of his character while usually accompanied with ""louder"" surroundings and backgrounds. it do feels like he was creating this whole world and spaces where he imagine what the album looks like, before you're listening to the first song. the fact that AKFG and Nakamura already worked together for so long is also amazed me. you can't think of one without the other, and this create this mutual connection in this zeitgeist, which was awesome.

all and all, now you know who's the man behind almost every AKFG's CD jacket. for more Yusuke Nakamura's art, I'll also put his works collaborating with Bocchi The Rock to commemorate their first arena one-man live concert of Kessoku Band. enjoy!","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471036738506854430/AKFG2C_Landmark_album_art.png?ex=69960af9&is=6994b979&hm=15c7ad33429bbd8d2b50dce4aba1e749a24b159094a5b098d64c6ef3ef265e75&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471036738905575537/KSCL-2372.png?ex=69960af9&is=6994b979&hm=3cd02c0024b00476a4a5f9a29e5061037e5f48ebea79fcbc93d521aa49c4b2c5&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471036739253571702/976c9f491abfc71194ff1a3bf64e4f34.png?ex=69960af9&is=6994b979&hm=506f752eea71a674374312f7178ec577f0153624ebe820cf799e20390c432369&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471036739576660057/image.png?ex=69960af9&is=6994b979&hm=bfd63c3a9b3182b8226ba46fd8e138f08498dcec2ad3e64587aac1bc82134ad8&","❤️ (2)"

- pertama tentu saja without aa shadow of a doubt, Goyol's Mongolian outfit. the cashmere belted robe, the horn hat, and also the overall colors is great. not the most eye popping colors, but its very on theme imho. a very good staple of what winter Olympic outfits should be.

- kedua sepertinya haiti? like, how tf they created such a summer-y, tropical-y, islander-y outfits but still looks warm? like, ofc it its a padded jacket and skirts, but the headdress, the green colors, the red horse, really wins me over. it's very creative, and i think Stella Jean and Edouard Duval-Carrié really cooking with this one

- ketiga mungkin agak bias for OBVIOUS reasons, but Moncler's attempt to create Brazil's ski squad uniforms is also amazing. i like the star motifs and also just how simple and drippy it was. truly such a scene imho.

- INI AGAK BORING MAAF TAPI RALPH LAUREN FOR TEAM USA IS ALSO GREAT LIKE HOWWWWWWWWWW THE FFFFFFFFFF U GOT RANGE EVERYTIME RALPH LAUREN??????? like the knitted innerwear, white coat with wooden button, and the knithead???? crazy colors and looks for sure

- terakhir yang saya notis sih Lululemon for Canada sih ya... simple, color popping puffer jacket that actually was inspired by Canada's landscape such as the lush forest, maple leaves, and ofc the lakes. but their puffer with huge maple leaf really wins me over. proud moment for canada for sure

jd begitulah leon.... sorry for the late reply and hope that u also enjoy Milano Cortina~","",""

Shell Chuan Chim award was first established in 1961 by Thanadsri Svasti, a Thai writer, singer, and actor but famously know as food journalist and reviewer for this panel. the story was Prince Bhisadej Rajani, a marketing manager at Shell Thailand at the time, approached Thanadsri to help create a soft advertising campaign for its newly launched cooking gas products. Inspired by the Michelin Guide, they came up with the idea of a food review column, to be written by Thanadsri and sponsored by Shell, and named it ""Shell Chuan Chim"" which translated to ""Shell urges you to taste"". Thanadsri travelled throughout the country, visiting restaurants and recommending venues that offered great-tasting food, and became known as a guarantee of excellence, and was extremely influential, since they're featured and also putting up the Shell Chuan Chim sign.

there's actually a website for their records and list of restaurants in Thailand, but i can't read it because it was all in Thai and i can't read one lol. but if you're interested, u can check them out at https://shellshuanshim.com/ for more information regarding their scoring system, their yearly recap, and also list of must visits while you're in certain areas. or maybe, you can also hunt for the bowl sign, which is Shell Chuan Chim's logo. their logo was this white bowl with green details, and also there's some thai underneath translated to ""Welcome to Taste"" in red. i don't think you will missed it lol.

all and all, i think this is pretty cool for your own country to have their own restaurants grading systems. because tbh with you, i don't think we should trust influencers that only focused on ""instagrammable"" and ""aesthetic"" restaurants lol.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471388806426005628/image.png?ex=6996015c&is=6994afdc&hm=75111819ebc81b4a76b7cceb2b4c951f9be1f04daae45fdeffca6ce0b9cef768&",""

so I'm a smoker, right. and i think as a human, whether you're a smoker or not, i think we tend to romanticize smoking too much. we kinda put smoking into this ""light"" where we see cigarette as a cool thing, even where smoking was known for its addiction and illness inducing thing. for example, we kinda identify cigarettes with cool things thanks to their branding like cowboys, fast cars, masculinity, extreme actions, survivals, and others. other branding forms of cigarettes also included in memes, where a lot of people talk about ""smoking like parisienne type of way"" or ""European breakfast"" and ""girl/boy dinner"". even branded things also including smoking in mind, Casio's CRW-001, Dolce & Gabbana ashtray, even S.T. Dupont's entire accessories ideas, all derived from those activities.

if you ask me personally, i don't think i hate it, because i think everything and anything could be an aesthetic or ""mood"" in a way. a lot of us do think about it, not necessarily because we partake in those activities, but only because it looks cool, and cool things are everywhere. as a human, we are inspired by things around us, and it's only natural that cigarettes are counted to be one of those. we romanticized those things because we put that things into tons of perspective, whether its about life, love, pain, and others. one stick of cigarettes could be symbolized into anything that you feel, and symbolism is everywhere. its not a mere ""sickness in a box"" for me. i do think that it really symbolize one part of my life that i want to cherish, whether it was the first one i burned, the first one i shared with my friends, the fire i light with loved ones, the last butt i stomped outside of a bar in senopati, and other things. cigarettes really walks me down through the memory lanes, and it's not a bad thing at all.

probably smoking is what i have left, and i feel empty without it. but really, i don't care.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471609836717473855/image.png?ex=69962676&is=6994d4f6&hm=c8d6820886b48d8ce7e050b3c5f65a80dcc376132313530e4cee06a3a8d55d2f&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471609837258280991/image.png?ex=69962676&is=6994d4f6&hm=7163e5470fffa196a823eacce284551b477a81f5a8f05639ca01e37f651328e4&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471609837761859657/images.png?ex=69962676&is=6994d4f6&hm=6db385e236d243f785ea9e8024158c035efc31d5715b09baecea1ae464e610fd&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1471609838256525382/image.png?ex=69962676&is=6994d4f6&hm=955d88a0c5823f7bdfb8c162455da930b5a31b8f9ffef639e1b36491e5fdfcf0&","❤️ (1)"

at first i bought a set of cork coasters from ikea. it was a good and durable one, but a bit boring tbh. it has no design, colors, or just anything unique and it kinda becoming an eyesore after a while. i was actually looking up coasters online to expand my collections and just basically giving myself some variations, but it all changed once i went to this cafe with konco. they had a cool, yellow paper coaster with white lines and design and i got one when they serve me my drinks. due to my lack of better judgements, i yoinked that thing when we left the cafe lmao (legally) (i guess) (kinda....?) (for LEGAL REASONS pls don't replicate this action). but since that day, i become addicted to ~~steal~~ borrow some coasters from various cafes and restaurant that i went to. my friends even participated in this hobby (AGAIN, PLS DON'T DO IT), giving me ~~stolen~~ coasters to be added to the collection for the hell of it. i mean... now i own probably around 30-40 coasters (?), and all of them are cool and have tons of stories behind it.

all and all, yes i do own various coasters. yes all of them are cool. yes some of them can be seen below. no pls don't give me your stolen coasters when we meet irl. and no pls don't do this like frfr JANGAN NYOLONG KARENA LOTSO DID THAT TOO OK TRIMS EVERYONE HV A GOOD DAY","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1441326388891226122/1472502911706730627/image.png?ex=69961a73&is=6994c8f3&hm=7d7bdb8996a981de88798a7a479c63554bd963d611bec6120189f6c8c7571650&","🔥 (1)"
