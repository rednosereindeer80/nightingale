In Pasal 49 of Undang-Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1986 jo. Undang-Undang No. 9 Tahun 2009, it is stated that: 

""Pengadilan tidak berwenang memeriksa, memutus, dan menyelesaikan sengketa Tata Usaha Negara tertentu
dalam hal keputusan yang disengketakan itu dikeluarkan:
a. dalam waktu perang, keadaan bahaya,keadaan bencana alam, atau keadaan luar biasa yang
membahayakan, berdasarkan peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku;
b. dalam keadaan mendesak untuk kepentingan umum berdasarkan peraturan perundang-undangan yang
berlaku.""

This interests me, as the law itself, while direct, is quite clear in stating that any *Gugatan PTUN*/State administrative lawsuit can be rejected in in an emergency moment, presents a possible avenue for misuse of the Article. If the *Keputusan Badan atau Pejabat TUN* has passed the statutory time limit, which is regulated under Pasal 55 UU PTUN, stating a limit of 90 days.

There's a clear avenue for the state to be free of consequences if they've misused its power.

There has not been any usage of pasal 49 to reject administrative lawsuits and make them inadmissible, as most  judges have rejected every defendant that have submitted a reason and exception for the case to be considered: ***Cacat Hukum***.

While the law itself has not been used even in MA as a *kasasi* and *PK (Peninjauan Kembali)*, that I know of,  the existence of the law and under the right situation and condition, can be used for the wrong reason and should be given guard rails that aren't just relying on judges' jurispundece but written law or even SEMA to give guidelines and respecify those emergency situations.","",""

The current UU that regulates Komnas HAM is moreso inefective and the suggestion made by Komnas HAM is often ignored and not really taken into consideration in public policy, not to mention the ad hoc manner in which Peradilan HAM is being conducted.

By transforming Komnas HAM as a constitutional level  organizational  instead being regulated via the current UU which only based upon UUD to be enacted, I want to respecify UUD that regulates HAM (29A-30) to include the organizational operability of  Komnas HAM, and in that process of strengtening Komnas HAM position.

Give it actuall powers and a lex fori ( or a place to hold court) and its judges, not just from an ad hoc basis, with the deliberate consequences to make Komnas HAM backed court order to have weights and a mechanism of effective prosecutors","",""
