There are two types of flails back then during medieval age: peasant and military. Military flail had been developed since 10th century, becoming widespread in 11th to 13th century. Yet the chief advantage in their flailing effect also produced the similar disadvantage in which they can accidentally hit their own allies or even self should they make a mistake when swinging such weapon.

This is where the peasant flails came in. In most cases, these are two-handed agricultural flails, which can be weaponized by peasants during late Middle Ages. These weapons can deliver blunt damages to the armored knights or men-at-arms, giving a good amount of pain to strike them down. Some even modified the weapon to featured anti personnel studs or spikes attached in the striking end, delivering a painful blow. The Hussites during their wars, employed peasants with flails to strike down the outnumbered enemies or thrown down knights with long pole weapon, attached with a striking end that can be swung. 

The peasant flail proved to be quite an easy weapon to be used for peasants during its standard, making it widely used by many peasant armies of the Hussites. The earliest of these weapons were mainly made with woods, though later modifications can make these flails to be spiked with iron spikes, or simply layered with iron cover to deliver more fatal blows.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353301477413879858/1353301477677994108/speozq9aipy61.png?ex=699630f7&is=6994df77&hm=05f297202f98682d841f8bb02bce439e051ecb3b393b506ea64bbccb72382eb2&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353301477413879858/1353301478030180453/26740.png?ex=699630f7&is=6994df77&hm=125de560240f2790acbeb4c8ead299de94a614d134d1480480e933982a1314ec&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353301477413879858/1353301478391021619/cfc7111a1ea6e760370e9db0d7e25425.png?ex=699630f7&is=6994df77&hm=c447a1da70a2e519bb0de53e0262c2b654877db827f8fea0d3e4b94865859e57&",""

- Wooden Pole (attached with chains then have another a spike or blunt force attached to it)

Tactics:
- Use wooden poles and ropes for cheaper materials. Then have a smaller wooden block attached to it.
- Allow the flail users to be in the back of the line or in second and third rank.
- Have them coordinated well by swinging these flails when the riot forces are coming with the shields and batons
- Ensure that these flail users are not getting too close or too packed with the other protesters and riot forces. Their main advantage would be diminished instantly.

Advantages:
- It swing its weapon, hitting personnel even with shields.
- Long reach weapon, it can deliver blunt damage while staying in a distance
- Allowing protesters to have secondary or primary defense when the riot forces were deployed
- It can halt the advance of the riot forces at least for a while.
- Better defense on fortified positions and higher ground.


Disadvantage:
- It can't fight well when the personnel are getting too close to the distance, it lose its power almost immediately.
- It can be stuck if not careful when it tight spaces or formations.
- It can be impractical in tighter formations which can hit other allies when being swung.
- The user must use it as a two handed-weapon, which left them vunerable to attacks more than often if left exposed.
- To make shorter of it is possible, but at the cost of range and its handle.","","👍 (1)"
