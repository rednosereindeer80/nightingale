With the unpopular leadership created by the previous government, the government forced to elect the more stable and compromising figures to lead the society into another 5 years of presidency. Thus they resorted to monarchs being taken as candidates for the Indonesian presidency. There are a few figures that can be counted as popular demands according to general public's perceptive (which is very interesting to be discussed).","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353344052979830934/1353344053411971142/sinden-women-who-sing-accompanying-traditional-javanese-gamelan-orchestra-batang-indonesia-september-sinden-women-who-sing-339743565.png?ex=6996589e&is=6995071e&hm=b5b37fd3d3ddca2b916751216bce59f20385110593ef92a6ad422a2e4d22a2d4&",""

```Possibly the most able figure of all available for the current nobility, whether it is through fame, experience and competency. In terms of his background other than being a noble and Sultan, his former education was law as his major in Gajah Mada University, with him leading the alumni organization, Keluarga Alumni Universitas Gajah Mada (KAGAMA). In his organization history, he even had ever become affiliated with Gerindra during his service as DPD Leader of Gerindra in Yogyakarta, combined with him become the one that declared the founding of Nasdem along with Surya Paloh back in 2010. There are a few possible things that could be expected in his policies should he become the President of Indonesia:

1. Promotion of Culture & Traditions
Like every nobility in Java, he had always been the symbol of Javanese philosophy (Hamemayu Hayuning Bawana), in which he emphasized the idea of keeping the balance and harmony as part of its culture. There are a high potential where he would promote more Javanese culture and traditions inside his political foundation along with his decision making. Culture and arts would be further promoted, with him might even fund various artistic and cultural projects. This is more than obvious due to his status that demand him to do so as a symbolic leader of both Indonesia & Yogyakarta. Further education program about traditional arts and culture is also possible.

2. Relation With Gerindra & Nasdem
Again, with his relationship with both Gerindra and Nasdem, he could be a good figure to control a few political parties to agreed on his administration, further passing some reforms if needed. This may or may not be feasible, but depending on how he enacted compromises while guiding it to achieve his presidential objectives: a coalition compromise between Gerindra, Nasdem and Hamengkubuwono X is not possible. We might even see Nasdem and Gerindra officials being employed further in his cabinet.```","",""

With his way of leadership for the past few years, it can be described to be a low profile one. He would rather not be an outstanding figure for the sake of keeping his administration together while his men do the works systematically. There would be compromises being made but for the sake of achieving his objective in promoting cultural traditions. His leadership mainly focused on keeping things together without too much dramas nor tensions happening, which what might many Indonesians enjoy should he be in the office. He can be seen as an able administrator too, considering he had been ruling as a governor for decades with him knowing his way out in working, collaborating and harmonizing the relationship between him and the other political parties.

4. Tourism
During his reign as a Governor of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubowono X was seen as creating a new image and brand for Yogyakarta for people to visit. This includes the promotion of tourism for a lot of times. And for this tourism to succeed, he would need to further to promote the beauty of culture and arts of his estates. A similar progress can be seen should he become the president. Many arts, cultural events, various display, and even buildings would be enacted to promote tourism through distinct unique culture of Indonesia. His policy for job creation will possibly came from the idea of tourism and arts too, where they can employ more people to worked in these sectors.```","",""

1. This Is Democracy, Not Monarchy
Just like any feudal leaders being seen taking the office, many can be skeptical with his opposition can pointed out his heritage as a sign that he is unfit to rule as a democratic leader. It is highly potential that parties such as PDIP, Perindo and PKS would oppose his rule due to his ties with Gerindra & Nasdem along with other list of reasons. He would need a strong backing and sponsors from the political parties that choose him as a candidate to rule over Indonesia. Suffice to say, his inexperience in ruling a democracy compared to feudal region can be shown during the early reign of his.

2. Struggling In Economy
He wasn't the best economist available for a ruler. As a matter of fact, he isn't really known for being an able economist to begin with, but a slow yet steady ruler that prefer progressive state of movement. Yet in this case, Indonesia may or may not be able to follow up with the current modernization progress, including AI, global economy, etc. He will relied on various economist experts to help him, but it could resulted to the progress being compromised should these figures are the same oligarchs of the former government before his reign.

3. Hidden Corruption
In order to keep his presidency steady, he will appear low profile while handling things steadily. This is not a weakness as many would prefer it just like any conservatives, but this method can be fatal in addressing various issues of corruption. Corruption could undermine his rule and popular support, with some may even called him as indecisive in handling the corruption issue similarly during SBY's reign. There are good chances he might even ignore corruption for the sake of keeping political stability as long it is not that destructive for his objectives for collective harmony.```","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353344052979830934/1353353577967521906/Hamengkubuwono_x.png?ex=6996617d&is=69950ffd&hm=b9774a1b0d657292492876af4c8d36c7436b29f403e8603e1a0b6c8c83fb0e5d&",""

```Another potentially able candidate for the presidency. He had some fair share of background before his reign, such as leader of the Keraton Surakarta Museum, Caltex Pacific Indonesia, and some other institutions that he used to worked with. In his organization history before being crowned the rightful ruler of the Surakarta, he had also participated in Organisasi Amatir Radio Indonesia. Yet other than that, his history was filled with the conflict between his siblings due to the matter of succession. There had been quite a history where his background is quite chaotic before and during his reign as a Susuhunan of Surakarta. Thus if a person such as Pakubuwana XIII would take the throne, there is a potential for his presidency to be in turmoil should it not be managed right:

1. Ennoblement & Titles For Loyalty
His reign was known to actually give a bunch of noble titles or honorary titles for members who contributed to his reign. This include his own servants, ministers, soldiers, polices, scholars or even commoners. These ennoblement or giving honorary titles could give him the power to control some loyalty from his subjects in order for his reign as a President. Yet many could also ignored these titles as they can simply sees it as honorary or formality than an actual grace to make them loyal to the President. Yet nevertheless, this simple reward and punishment system could be emphasized to be the playstyle of Pakubuwana's reign should he become the President. Even without giving titles, he could use his tactic to gain momentum in politics through securing deals with rewards with other political parties and members.```","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-03-23T18:38:18.4980000+00:00","```2. Position For Legitimacy
With his executive position, he could perhaps used it to improve his royal status and heritage. After all, his reign had been quite problematic for some time in real life, from fighting his own sibling during succession, to even his own subjects fought against each other with their own interests. Pakubuwana's reign could not only be painted with stabilizing the country itself, but also securing stability in his own Keraton. In order to do this, he could further try to enact his executive status to solidify his presence over the court, or even making some of his loyalists into the high positions of the government. Thus some nepotism could possibly happened in his rule within the cabinets where he elected his own Keraton subjects as government's staffs and ministers. Politically it is a good move, but whether they are competent or not, that will be answered through its practices.

3. A Cultural Figure of Java
Most conservative Javanese can agree that Pakubuwana XIII is the main cultural figure of Java itself. It has been recorded throughout history that he was very active as a ruler with the cultural events. There is a high possibility should he used his presidency to promote more cultural events, getting more Javanese artefacts, innovating in cultural tourism, along with giving rewards to encourage Javanese society to cultivate more of their traditions in return for titles, jobs, and various other rewards. It could be debated that they will try to even claim other estates and lands as their cultural heritage in order to promote their traditionalism.```","",""

During COVID-19, Pakubuwana XIII was responsible for giving 20,000 free vaccines to the general populace in his own realm. There is a possibility that social policies would be done in his reign as a president, though it would mainly focusing on the sector of health and education. Mainly he would be focusing in only these sectors should the situation calls for it, or a crisis ensue like last time. Regardless, other social policies will mostly include cultural and artistic aspects than having these aspects being covered.

Prominent Challenges In His Presidency:
1. Too Feudalistic For A Democracy
His strong and conservative feudal approach would be hard in dealing with the democratic aspects of the country, with his reign would struggled in stabilizing and familiarizing himself with the government's situation. He will enact policies like it is an imperial order, with possible resistance from other political parties will most likely exist in his reign. There is a chance the DPR will prevent him to push for anymore reforms if deemed too feudalistic to their liking. Compared to Hamengkubuwana X and other candidates, his method of governing will be the most outdated one.```","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-03-23T18:39:16.1530000+00:00","```2. Balancing Stability Everywhere
From his court and the government, he will potentially faces struggles in balancing between his courtly matter and governmental matters. His courts may try to gain positions inside the offices, while his government tried to keep their influence inside their own posts. Combined with his old age, the time he would spent to balance both the court and governmental matters will be very draining, with progress for reforms will be passed very slowly. To top that off, he isn't the brilliant politician nor ruler either, as his rule relied on him allocating and positioning figures to help easing up his burdens.

3. Nepotism & Connections
Eventually, the Surakarta ruler had to resort to his strongest suit of power gaming during his lifetime as Susuhunan of Surakarta: nepotism & connections. With his life filled with limited funds and resources to keep his Keraton maintained, he had to relied on donations along with other methods, possibly bringing that method inside his presidency. He will use familial connections and nepotism to gain favors from their positions. In resolving conflicts, he will try to use connections to limit the damages while pushing for reconciliation between both sides. While this may work as a political method, it won't work in negating other issues.```","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353344052979830934/1353437963207573544/SISKS-PB-XIII-02-819x1024.png?ex=69960754&is=6994b5d4&hm=6764293ed0991b2056b3cb26bb5c965cbeb97a14aa4803233a31ca654377000f&",""

```The youngest candidate of all Mataram branch of houses in Java. Recently nominated as a ruler of the Mangkunegaran in 2022, his background started off to be pretty humble, as he had never caused any form of controversy. But in all fairness, this also includes his achievements too, since he had only ruled as a ruler of Mangkunegaran for only a few years. This make him still new to the idea of feudal rule while at the same time, making him a more open-minded choice for the presidency as a Gen Z candidate:

1. Digitalization 
Mangkunegara X is open towards the idea of digitalization. This is stated in his idea that in order to promote the Java culture in Mangkunegaran, he relied on the usage of technologies to do this. Thus during his presidency, there is a possible chance he will promote further about the idea of digitalization for culture, tourism and even various sectors of industries. He will promote it in his reign as to achieve his objective in getting a soft power approach for the country. Should this succeed, Indonesia will oversaw a surge of digitalization in the government's policies, with some positive to be put, including AI.

2. Modernization of Tourism
Just like other noble candidates, Mangkunegara X believes in increasing revenues through tourism. As a matter of fact, he combined both digitalization and tourism in order to attract more foreigners visiting Indonesia, including local tourists in Mangkunegaran. This can go aligned with digitalization idea. His youth upbringing let him to be exposed to more social media and the internet as a Gen Z ruler himself. There is a good amount of chance we will see further improvement and creativity on tourism under the rule of Mangkunegara X.```","",""

As a Gen Z president and ruler of his own nobility, he would be regarded and shown in the spotlight as a bright young leader for the nation. His base support could be surrounded with younger generations which had been making up some majority of the populace. With this status, he could improve his relations with the general populace to gain some popular supports during presidency should he ever wished for getting a second term. Moreover, he could be like Gibran, using memes and pop cultures that the general younger generation enjoy.

4. Flexible Administrative Style
Due to him being young, he was noted to not follow what his predecessors truly followed in their style of leadership. Though he still adopted it, a more flexible administrative style would be his preference. With his young age, he can learn to adapt to the presidential style leadership even better than the usual conservative nobles in their old age. There would be some protests against it, but generally this is possibly the better choice of leadership should any nobles wanted to take the position as president of the country itself.```","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-03-24T13:34:40.6940000+00:00","```Prominent Challenges In His Presidency:
1. Young & Inexperienced
Just like Gibran, there are chances where his young age will be protested over by many. He is only 27 years old in 2025, which make him the youngest president to ever reigned in Indonesian history should such scenario do happen. Many would questioned such high jumps from his local status to immediately becoming the presidential candidate of the country. Similarly like Gibran, he will be attacked a lot due to his younger age combined with his inexperience in governing before (he only ruled his estate for 3 years after all).

2. No Good Political Backing
Due to his young age, he never really get the chance to even formed good relationship nor deals with other political parties. This will leave him heavily vunerable to convinced the other parties to support him when he was president. Many could choose to become his opposition instead of his supporters. Although it is not too late to form then made some good deals with other political parties, the chances of them being received compared to some other older nobilities are quite low.

3. Lack of Progress, Only Reputation
With the majority of the political parties didn't really back him up or at least keeping him only for stability, there is a chance that the country will stuck in mostly status quo condition. Nothing really changes, he simply sits there trying to pass reforms only to rejected when it doesn't really favor the majority of parties. He can try to give cabinet positions to his loyalists, but even they are not out of the reach for a coalition to petition the president on replacing him. Thus the only thing that holds his presidency together is his cultural status and reputation. He can try to surpass it with popular support, but even a popular support can be blocked by the cold hands of the government.```","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353344052979830934/1353723698141597716/iqapps6n8y2fant5o34c_16378.png?ex=699668b0&is=69951730&hm=f8b85573c0db84657ce64b36ea7b131164e1665f81009545108eae47c21a89aa&",""

In terms of background before his coronation, he was a student of economic faculty in UPN. He had a brief familial dispute regarding on his position as a ruler of Pakualaman by his reign until 2022. There are things to be expected during his presidency:

1. A Decent Administrator
As a Vice-Governor of Yogyakarta, people can expect at least decent experience from his governance that can be implemented in Indonesia. Though playing mostly in the sideline of the administration, he did quite a few decent jobs, such as emphasizing reporting system in his reign, establishing diplomacy with other parties, and enacting what seems to be in his capacity without any controversy. One can say that if he took the office as a president, he will use this skill to create a proper status quo for the country, keeping the country running in a decent but stable manner. It may look like stagnant for many, but sometimes stability is something that everyone wants, and Pakualam X is the man for the job.```","",""

Similarly like other leaders, Pakualam X emphasized the idea of cultural promotion and protection. Being a cultural figure in Java, he will promote more Javanese culture by investing funds, while elevating the position for ministry of culture and arts as a way to preserve the traditional culture and rights for Indonesia. As a form of support for Yogyakarta and other noble houses, he will grant more autonomy or federalized state for the local governments. This can grant a boost of support from the royalist figures inside his office for the sake of giving him legitimacy to rule through many royals exist in Indonesia. Although it might not be the best option to even put capable members in offices, but there is a chance that other government officials or parties will try to make their relation closer to him due to this legitimacy.

3. Tourism & Soft Power
He believed in promoting tourism while negotiating with multiple sides to increase the soft power in the table for Yogyakarta. So there is a chance he will use media exposure along with his diplomacy to promote tourism industry in Indonesia. In his efforts, he will use Javanese culture to promote it, showing its uniqueness in front of various royalist that visited him. This may or may not even make some good relation with foreign royals such as Sultan of Brunei and Sultan of Malaysia. Further diplomatic deals can be gained through this connection that he gained, which can improve Indonesia's foreign policy with the two countries.

4. It Is Not A Cabinet, But A Family
Just like Sultan Hamengkubuwana X, Pakualam X emphasizes harmony as a way to solve conflicts. It would come to no surprise if he followed a more softer approach to resolve issues in his country. This come at a cost of compromising the positions, agendas and certain objectives in order to keep the legacy of him as a President.```","",""

1. The Question of Royalty
With him securing a place in his presidency, it will not take a while before the Yogyakartan residence along with the Sultan questioned him. This is true especially considering him being a vice governor suddenly took up the mantle as presidency will cause an overlap of power to the Sultan of Yogyakarta. Unless he can resolve it diplomatically, Sultan Yogyakarta could use his influence to disapprove his action, combined with the fact that Hamengkubuawana has relations with Gerindra and Nasdem.

2. Not A Brilliant Economist
Pakualam's main strength came from his diplomacy and administration, but his economic skill hasn't been the brightest one to be seen in his track record. He has a degree for management in economic faculty, but his way of running economy can be expected to be similar to old school economist. Thus in the scheme of things, he will be relying on old school economists and businessmen to make his reforms passed and done. This will only generate status quo for the economy except tourism which can cause corruption to still persist in certain sectors of the economy.

3. Not Great But Not Bad
He isn't the best administrator, but not the worst one. He is not the best popular figure, but not the worst one either. He isn't the best economist, but not the worst one too. Everything about him so far is decent, thus a stable rule is expected but also a status quo that will hold back many progresses that can benefits the country itself. In the grand scheme of things, he will be a decent ruler who can make the populace stay stable enough, if only he could create a stable political progress too. Yet for those who seek reforms, digitalization, and other innovations, Pakualam isn't the man suited for it. He was a man of process, enjoying the slow pace of things rather than embracing modernization fully.```","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353344052979830934/1354129762523676703/image0.jpg?ex=6996915d&is=69953fdd&hm=caff472c84979db3dc9f9e38ebef5c3da4f8acbf982e61aacc43e22d1a3d3abe&",""
