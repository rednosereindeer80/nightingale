We’re doing a mock UN Security Council meeting, and I have to represent Indonesia. The task is to pick the single most pressing issue for Indonesia in the 21st century and argue why it matters for global security. It could be anything from climate change, rising sea levels, deforestation, terrorism, South China Sea tensions, corruption, cyber/data leaks, energy security, to food security.

So if you had to choose ONE issue you think is the biggest for Indonesia, what would you pick?","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1418143376112484414/1418143376590766213/IMG_2109.jpg?ex=69961930&is=6994c7b0&hm=5ba7b7bbd601e13a413136c754b4a032c0d2e32255bd6b79146a91516c17f19b&","1000030762 (3)"

Just last week, Bali was hit by a flood that killed 20 people and devastated the local economy. The reason is that the green area is down to a worryingly low 3%. Deforestation of Kalimantan's forest also plays a role in climate change, which is getting more and more concerning.","","💯 (1)"

When breach happens (aka hacker stole it, not some employee expose or sell the data) the institutions are not punishable. The maximum punishment, then, based on the UU is 2% of Yearly Revenue. Meanwhile govt bodies do not have revenue.

They also do not include how Darkweb operates where merchants are very segmented and specialized. Data broker only sell data, access broker only sell access, ransomware gangs compromise companies by buying the stolen access/data.

my imagination of what happens during a breach made viral from a company:

1) company X breached. Forensics show result, hacker went in via stolen creds of an employee.

2) The stolen creds was bought by the hacker from data broker

3) data broker steal data from a govt institution

So company X blame the govt institution. The Govt institutions dont give a damn. Customer lose. Case closed :rose:","",""
