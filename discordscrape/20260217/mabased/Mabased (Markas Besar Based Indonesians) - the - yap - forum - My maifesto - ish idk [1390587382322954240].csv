Power lies where power wants, and wants are made by whom that makes and takes. 

Whom man looks and who man follows are lies construct. A noble lie they can be and a foul they might be, the ruler claims and the lesser follows but the lesser they cannot ignore.

What is power but a power to lie, what are lies but promises yet to be or never fulfilled. And fuffiled they can with power and might as lies become truth but still lies they are. Why men want to lead and why men want to follow and why they prefer the other or both is what is power and what power will do.

To think a fickle lie, a promise made, a dream uttered with passion and devotion yet they still have such power to command men from common to nobles alike.  Where are the lines for power to lie and what lies are made that is acceptable?

Do you guys think the perfect ideology are the ones that admits its not perfect? Ideology doesnt matter there is no concrete perfect grandplan. Are ideologies doomed to be trapped by the realities when it is created?

Does ideolgy even matter anymore as tool for controll just like how religion was before? When every man that can read and write has the potential to be their own philosopher, what good are ideologies but a mark of seperation, a cosmetic made out of pure or masked intention.


When ideologies doent matter anymore, what can unite mankind? Do we turn back to the good book and listen to what our lord said: be kind toward ur fellowman and make no violence and be gardener upon this earth, even if you never believe upon his existence?

Has we as men and women, in the illusion of grand civilization lied to ourself and make morals grey to justify the crimes we make?

When question becomes heresy what good is it for?
When beliefs becomes dogma, what is it  used  for?
When meaningless act becomes rituals, what good to believe in them?
When daily life becomes dogma, why are you willing to die for it?","",""

Ideologies fracture because they pretend to be whole.
When belief becomes dogma, truth becomes heresy.
Maybe unity isn’t in an ideology  but in the courage to doubt, and still be kind.
Maybe the only sacred act left… is to question.","",""
