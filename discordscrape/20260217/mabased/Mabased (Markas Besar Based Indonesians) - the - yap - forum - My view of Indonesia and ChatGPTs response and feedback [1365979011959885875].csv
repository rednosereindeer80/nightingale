I think its great if we could start beginning discussions on what us young people want to see as the fundamentals and fabric of our nation so that one day we can replace this flawed system that doesn't serve the current and the future. @everyone","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1365979011959885875/1365979012152950926/message.txt?ex=69962b57&is=6994d9d7&hm=1ae364587b5eaeaca5d19fc3b4e8ef147a181c43b14fcc3d29af290a7abb3817&","debate (6)"

Indonesians are ~~wealthy~~, ~~educated~~, ~~respected ~~globally.

~~High competition~~ and ~~high ambition~~ are cultural values.

1. This blueprint is actually a recipe for soft dictatorship by long term. A ""very strong president"" with longer terms risks morphing into an elected autocrat. Now I won't say this is a good or bad thing, but by long term it can't be relied upon, especially should there be a movement that calls for the government's democratization.
2. Now technocrats are a good product in theory, but who defines merit in this case? This system is potentially can be described to be anti-popular sovereignty, treating the citizens not as political agents (but by understandable reasons and means).
3. Forced elite-driven modernization, without community buy-in or representation, risks creating new regional rebellions and cultural alienation. I don't know if you are going to address this or you had already addressed this, but so far in the document I haven't found it yet. It is best to watch out for this part or else tensions could rise by short term with this centralization effort.
4. The International Relations part is actually very interesting, but risky too. I found the idea of having nuclear programs though needed, without proper communication and assurance can cause an international tension, and if further went into developing nuclear arms weapons, it could cause a regional arms race. Hopefully you will address this further for its solutions since I found this to be enticing.
5. Now I don't know if others felt the same way, but I mainly found a few contradictions in this file. Some of the points about liberalizing the economy while maintaining strategic protectionism, yet a potential for large amount of corruption is almost unavoidable even with anti-corruption. I personally find the content seem to demands loyalty and elite consensus while pushing for fierce competition and ambition. A tough spot to be a well balanced one, hopefully this part can be fixed.","",""
