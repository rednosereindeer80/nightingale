Quick intro, people usually call me Tata, and I’m currently working as a mid-level software engineer.

Now, onto the topic.
I used to serve as **secretary of IPNU** at the district level (PAC IPNU) from 2020–2022.
For those who might not know, IPNU is kind of like the **student council version of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU)**.

We did a lot of things, from **diskusi umum, bedah buku**, to internal engagement events that helped **strengthen our kinship and kaderisasi, both for IPNU and NU** in general.
We also organized external events such as **bagi-bagi makanan, pembagian zakat, and mass blood donor **, inviting not just our members but also people from around the district.

As students under NU, we were always reminded by our seniors (from Ansor or NU itself) **to participate in society the best way we can** — and I’ve always tried to live by that.

**My Thoughts on NU Today**

I still firmly believe that **NU holds this nation (bangsa) together**, even in today’s chaotic state.
Sure, many people online love to bash NU, and I get it.
Let’s be honest: **protests that hit the wrong target aren’t exactly the best way to express ourselves.**

At the same time, I also think **PBNU has made some huge mistakes** lately.
Their **statements** and **political stances feel rushed, sometimes even reckless**.

My dad, who’s also a senior NU activist, **predicted that by 2027, PBNU** could split into factions:
**those who follow Gus Yahya and those who don’t**. Maybe even more will emerge.
He suspects **that external groups use agents** and are trying to corrupt PBNU from the inside.

Personally, I think **PBNU has lost touch with its roots**.
They’ve forgotten that the **tanfidziyah and syuriyah** leaders are **chosen by the majority of Pimpinan Cabang (PCNU)** — the grassroots across Indonesia.
That’s where their legitimacy truly comes from.

Because of that, I believe the path to **real improvement must be bottom-up**, not top-down.
After all, **PBNU’s top structure exists because of votes and voices** from the regional levels and ideally, leadership candidates should also emerge from those same levels.

But here are the main problems I see:
1.    **NU is inclusive**, and that’s both its strength and weakness. Anyone can claim to be NU: ex-criminals, santri, teachers, corporate workers, even pengangguran.
On a cultural level, that’s beautiful. But structurally, it creates challenges.
2.    Because of that inclusivity, sometimes people **who aren’t fit end up in structural positions**. That’s why kaderisasi is crucial, to ensure the right people are in the right places.
3.    Unfortunately, **kaderisasi isn’t optimal across regions**.
If it were, we wouldn’t have cases like **PBNU inviting certain zionists** as speakers. That was a big red flag.
4.    Lastly, the structural bodies **aren’t working together effectively**.
There’s a **lot of talent** inside NU, but the organization **fails to utilize it**.
Many **overvalue religious achievements** alone, which, while important, are **not enough to face the challenges** of today’s world.

**My Question to You All**

So, what do you think we should do?
At least for our current IPNU structurals in my district — how can we **strengthen ourselves**, both as an **organization** and as **individuals**?

Because in the end, our ultimate goal remains the same:

**Untuk berkontribusi kepada Bangsa in the best way possible.**","",""

PS: Yes I used AI, but only to enhance the sentences structure, I told GPT to not even translate the Indonesian terms to make it still as casual as possible. My un-AI-ed version would be too unbearable to read LOL

1. this org is so freakin massive that doing a funding in a large scale is sometimes a bit tricky
2. So many traditionalist is a true obstacle of progress like you said. The elders in regional levels often cannot catch up with the overwhelming tech changes

Both combined, those made the loyalist think that the only way to contribute are often narrowed to:
1. contribute as structural officers
2. contribute with mengabdi ke guru & masyarakat langsung sedari dini
3. contribute financially

Those are important, but, it made the ones chasing educations and careers in technical fields often forgotten.

Thus, making the system undervalue the ones chasing educations and careers in technical fields, and overvalue those above, who are in the existing system directly.","",""
