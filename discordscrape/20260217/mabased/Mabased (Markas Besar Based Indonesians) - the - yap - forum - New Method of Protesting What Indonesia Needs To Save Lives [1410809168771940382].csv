Here are a few points of this method:
1. Smaller groups formed from various organizations can have joint training on how to properly demonstrate and organizing themselves.
2. It is important that these smaller groups formed to a large group during protests but being able to disperse back to their original small groups when avoiding or retreating from the protests. Actions can last minutes to an hour, not days but remain consistent throughout weeks or months.
3. Smaller groups should formed their own cells, intelligence and scouting system for proper place to demonstrate. 
4. Protesters use motorbikes, small streets, or public transport to regroup in different places. And due to smaller groups nature to begin with, they can fairly escape with less mobility compared to being a larger group.","",""
