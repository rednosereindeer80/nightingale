But i think this is wrong, vague, and unclear

So, does any of you have any ""alternatives"" or ""critiques"" of the current political compass/spectrum?","",""
"843005270200156160","kaviarormonroe","2025-04-24T14:46:44.0560000+00:00","okay so the terms emerged as an analogy to the early part of the French revolution in 1789, where those delegates to the national assembly who supported the revolution stood and sat on the left side of the room, those who supported the monarchy and the status quo, occupied the the right side.  

When you use an analogy like this, you’re inferring that there is some feature that links the people you’re referring to in your time with the right or left sides of the national assembly in 1789, and this is true even if you’re not really conscious of what that feature is, like even if you’re just sort of feeling it instinctually, which is what people are doing most of the time.   But then we obviously can see where this fails, that the problem is that its too fuckin VAGUE!","",""

Most people would say that left right political spectrum is about rankings – classes or ranks in a hierarchy – and these classes and hierarchies can be political, economic, cultural and international. 

Owners on top, management in the middle, workers on the bottom.  
Government on top, citizens on the bottom.  Or in a patriarchal culture you’ll have men on top, women at the bottom.  The medieval King on top, nobles in the middle, serfs on the bottom.

But there are also a bunch of other popular definitions of the left-right political spectrum floating around: the market vs. the state, big vs small government, the individual vs. the collective, equality vs. liberty","",""
"843005270200156160","kaviarormonroe","2025-04-24T14:49:03.4650000+00:00","But then again if we look at the modern consensus on what is left and what is right, it would appear contradictory to the definition itself!

Famous example :
Why is Stalin on the left when Hitler is on the right? 
When hitler’s germany and stalin’s USSR had many important similarities – They were both capitalistic in their mode of production - generalized commodity production, wage labour everywhere, also heavily industrialized. They were also both heavy handed dictatorships that enslaved a good chunk of their people, they both used nationalism to maintain the power of the ruling party, and they both engaged in imperialism.

And there comes another problem with the political compass - they make us focus on superficial aspects of politics like that don’t give us any insight into the actual divisions and political coalitions that exist in the real world","","👍 (1)"
