Some people say I can live my life slowly, not to rush, enjoying little things in life, and be gratefull for what I have. It's actually great, I do appreciate my life no matter how good or bad. But I currently having no certain goals or aspiration. Also, my life might not always goes smothly. But as human, I want to do my best and minimilize any regret in the future. 

Based on your experiences, what is your advice, suggestion, opinion, reminder, and lessons for youngster to face the future? Is there anything to prepare, to learn, or to be fix? Or maybe something to explore?

Not gonna lie, as a newborn adult, I'm not really optimis with the country's current situation. All these issues, system, sosio-culture, and stuff makes me lost in track, I'm genuinely confused.","",""

going abroad expand your horizons, its also a chance to experience many new things. while abroad you can also look for scholarship, summer school, etc and you can also consider whether you want work overseas as an alternative.","","debate (2)"

- have a skill that make you able to work online
---> this is because office jobs as we knew pre-covid have vanished
- try to get abroad even for just 3-6 months to test the water
- if not possible, try to do small gig / biz. anything can as long as not violating the law.

intangible advices:
- get ready for surprises you really don't like at all
- be at peace with yourself (at least 80% of it)
- you will find that reality will hit hard at your face. prepare for alternative roadmaps.","","debate (1)"

The strongest one was once the most weakest.

The bravest one was once the most fearful.

The one closest to the word ""perfection"" was once the furthest from it.

Struggles are only a course of nature that shaped metals into swords, and people into champions.

Explore widely, think critically, build gently, and love sincerely.

You don’t have to rush, but you do have to move. 

Don’t expect passion to appear fully formed, for its fruits are the labor of the tree of experience.

You will not always feel hopeful, and the world will not always be fair. Yet your response to that reality will become your strength. 

And if you feel lost, remember: direction is often found not by knowing, but by moving.

Purpose comes from presence. Meaning grows where attention is planted.""

I live my life with thought of ""I could possibly died tomorrow, so I must do my progress as fast as possible and write down my idea. So in case I died, there will be someone who continiued my journey with those progress and notes.""

Just like Khabib advice to send kids to Dagestan. All u need is dropped into hard situation, cuz surviving and improving gonna be the only option.

Lack of these scene is what leading kids to think 'I just need to finish my study and graduate' instead of 'I need to make my own way to survive as soon as possible'.","","sad (1)"
