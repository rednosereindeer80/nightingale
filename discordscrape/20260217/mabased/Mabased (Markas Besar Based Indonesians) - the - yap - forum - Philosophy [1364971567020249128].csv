But that is true. right now happiness for me is to have me as a son that could make my parents proud, a brothers and sisters' keeper, a place to see that people can point in public ""there look at him so high in place, his parents must be proud, he is a loyal son.""

I am still shackled by the notion of a clan/fammilial thinking, no matter how much i have learned, I love them too dearly  no matter how many they have hurt me.

Happiness is ever constant (hehe) but is it really that bad for it to be such an abstract of a concept?

A dream to chase while still feeling satisfied is happiness on it self. A distant dream it maybe yet through the sorrow you went trough, light will always be there, you just have to grasp it, and accept all it bitterness to savor its sweetness.","",""

in soviet democracy candidates can and did come from all walks of life, money isn't an issue in soviet democracies and its ""peripheries"" (cuba, mongolia etc) unlike in liberal democracy where candidates are expected to fork over literal millions just to be able to engage in politics, and theres no disenable system of replacing candidates either once voted in part due to the access of wealth that they posses. in the early years of the soviet union a system of recall was routinely practiced this can range from village level officials recalling those from up in national level officials out of their offices' that is the answer to your question ""how is soviet democracy a realer form of democracy if it restricts voters to one party and curbs on the influence of bourgeois movements?"" the one party lets poor people in thats a luxury that most bourgeois parties dont offer even to this day, and this is just basic entryism and i only manage to dive into the recall process.

democracy isn't a system within itself, it is a the basis for political organizations and structures to be formed upon. soviet democracy restricts the influence of the bourgeoisie and liberal democracy restricts the influence of the proletariat, which voter base makes up a majority in any given country? the people who enslave you or the slaves.","",""

Germany, the United Kingdom, France, for example, has laws against unduly influencing an election by money. Candidates are given a strict money purse and must not expend past that for campaigns and so on. While that *doesn't* eliminate the issue of money, that does mitigate it somewhat. Even if we accept that, it does not mean that when we turn around, Soviet democracy is somehow better. village-level officials recalling national ones out of office. That simply does not happen. 

The Soviet system worked like this: Citizens elect their local council who then elects the regional council who then elects the provincial council who then elects the Supreme Soviet or the national legislature. Thing is, with so many intermediaries between the citizens and the nation's rulers, you cannot hold them to account. Okay, say your provincial governor is fucking wild. He's doing shit you don't approve of even though what he's doing is fine by the Party. What can I do? Take it up with my local council? That person has to take it up with the regional council, and there's no guarantee that (a) my complaint will be delivered, (b) that it will even be heard, and (c) that the regional council then does something for that. In a liberal democracy, I can easily vote against that governor when the next election comes up.

How does Soviet democracy restrict the bourgeoisie if there is no mechanism in which the citizens are able to hold their representatives into account? If the Party got infected by bourgeois elements, how can I fight against that? How can I prevent that? You can't. Why? Because anyone who wants to run for office has to be approved by the Party. See the error? The Party perpetuates itself. I have no voice because I have no choice.","",""

 **You made a claim that the Soviet form of democracy was better because people could recall their representatives but I countered that claim which _YOU_ did not answer. How can people take their soviets into account when the people's voice is restricted (since all candidates are either members of the party or approved by the party) and only local as the regional, provincial, and national soviets were elected NOT by the people and instead of their lower soviets?**

_This serves as a reminder that presenting sound, well-reasoned arguments does not always lead to constructive dialogue. In some cases, individuals may feel intellectually cornered or emotionally unsettled, causing them to abandon logical discourse. As a result, they might resort to ad hominem attacks, sarcasm, deflection, or other forms of unprofessional behavior. While this reaction can be frustrating, it is often a sign that the argument has struck a chord. Recognizing this dynamic allows one to remain composed and focused, avoiding the temptation to engage on the same level and instead maintaining the integrity of the discussion._

Basically this statement is meant for to answer a philosophical question of how we can verify our existence. How can we ensure that our existence isn't just some simulation, illusion or even a lie in the first place. Rene Descartes stated that ""I think, therefore I am,"" which suggested that we do exist since our existence was marked by the question of our existence alone. 

if one is able to think, even to doubt, then they must exist as a thinking entity, which suggest that their existence is not one of a lie.","",""

> I will suppose, then, that everything I see is fictitious. I will believe that my memory tells me nothing but lies. I have no senses. Body, shape, extension, movement and place are illusions. So what remains true? (...) If I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed.
> But there is a supremely powerful and cunning deceiver who deliberately deceives me all the time! Even then, if he is deceiving me I undoubtedly exist: let him deceive me all he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing while I think I am something. So after thoroughly thinking the matter through I conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, must be true whenever I assert it or think it.
the ""he"" refers to a supremely powerful demon that deceives descartes about everything
its a device for him to doubt things such as mathematics","","🔥 (3)"
