For the last decade, there had been significant advances or declines within various Indonesian political parties. Using a few credible sources, mainly from journals, social media and news articles, this tier list was created for the sake of some light entertainment (so take it with a grain of salt with a few discussions here and there) with sources to back a few of these results. There are a few things to be pointed out before continuing the tier list:
-    Most of the political parties originated from the Reformation Era with a few exceptions for those that are still alive until this day. Old political parties that had been defunct or erased before Reformation Era will not be included (just a few clarifications)
-    Regional parties such as the Acehnese political parties won’t be counted due to their special privileges, making them an exception for regional legislatures representatives. 
-    This tier list will only cover parties that are represented in national and regional legislatures. 
-    Documents and even social media accounts of these parties will also be seen in order to further add more materials to observe, including the explanation of their agendas, programs, etc. Political party websites would also be included to add the credibility of certain analysis.","","👍 (2)"

Challenges in the process of making the tier list itself came with a few points to consider for the credibility of the tier list:
-    Lack of financial records from the parties, as most parties tend to not report or commonly miscalculated their own budgets. Whether it is for campaign funds or their own programs.
-    Inactive websites or links that are not working for a few cases to further analyze the party’s programs and progress.
-    Due to no primary datas to support the tier list, there are no guarantees that this political tier list will be an absolute credible source to rate the political parties in Indonesia. Furthermore, changes by the next year or even by 2029 could make this tier list had to be changed or updated in order to follow up the events that might impacted these parties’ scores. 
Furthermore, there are 7 core measurements in order to establish whether a political party is an effective political party:
1.    Electoral strength
Measuring the voting turnout and seats won, showing the party’s influence and public support. This section usually shows 
2.    Internal governance
Assessing the governance of the party, including its decision-making processes, institutional structure, and the transparency in conducting the democratic governance.
3.    Policy & program coherence
Clear policies and programs that address the public needs, along with its implementation on the field.
4.    Outreach & inclusiveness 
Measuring the engagement with members, voters, stakeholders, and inclusion of diverse groups.
5.    Financial strength & management
Funds that the party gathered, spend and manage with its transparency.","",""

Seeing the steadiness and reliability of the party inside the political environment.
7.    Organizational capacity
Observing how structured and managed the party is to achieve its goals.

The tier list will be separated into 7 categories (F to S) for the scores for each core measurements, before finally be sum up to make the total average score for the political party in general.","",""

"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-05T05:22:18.8050000+00:00","Brief History:
The newest political party ever since 2022, it was formed to follow a former chairman of the Demokrat party, Anas Urbaningrum. Other notable Demokrat members also joined this party such as I Gede Pasek Suardika and Ian Zulkifar. The party took over the former Partai Karya Perjuangan with the rebranding as the Partai Kebangkitan Nasional. After Anas being released from jail due to corruption, he was given the position as the head of the party. Their latest achievements would be that they’ve gained multiple seats for provincial and regency legislative seats back in 2024.

Electoral Strength (E):
For a new minor political party, the party managed to gain at least a few seats inside DPRD for the level of regency/city and legislative. However, most of these seats are gained from South Sumatra, Highland and Central Papua, which only make up for a minimum influence to enforce their policies or agendas. At best, the party can enforce a city or regency’s local policy to represent their interest but no more than that. Most likely, they have to follow other parties’ policies or interests that are similar to them in order to be able to get the piece of cake of the joint cooperation.

Internal Governance (E):
Governance wise, it is still reliant on top to down leadership, as the party’s whole existence is to follow Anas Urbaningrum to begin with. The party at least still form a proper institutional leadership with its structure possibly followed Demokrat’s structure with their former Demokrat members’ experience. The problem is that Demokrat’s structure isn’t exactly a good standard either for an internal governance.  There were limited information that can be found about the party’s internal governance order than the positions inside the party, with decision-making process is still quite hidden while lacking the transparency it supposed to has as a party. This left the party possibly having similar problems with the Demokrat party itself with their elitism.","",""

There are no clear policy and program orientation in PKN. Most of the time during 2024, their policies or agendas focused on the vibe that they are “a new party that is not a political dynasty, with clean records and no controversies” (ironically their leader is already controversial with his corruption records). Moreover, during the campaign, they tried to styled themselves to be a party for young people to vote for though it didn’t specify their agendas furthermore. This further make their policy and the coherence of their programs never make any clear message during the election, putting them in the bottom score. Even when taking a look at their ideology explanation, most of them are pretty normative. It resides in the idea of modern nationalism that focused on the principles of democracy, Pancasila and social welfare. Their emphasis to put their ideological focus on national unity, social justice, and “people-based economic development” still needed to be written in a clearer manner within their policies & programs.","",""

The party’s outreach and inclusiveness became another weakness for the group despite trying to make an outreach to younger populace. Their promotions and advertisements clearly followed the vibe of Demokrat party, but with changes (such as the usage of AI generated contents). The public’s reaction on the party itself through social media was not received considering there are frequent reports of people having their identities being included as part of the political party in 2024. Most members within the spotlight of the party are clearly former Demokrat members or elites, which made the inclusiveness for other minorities or specific groups lacking. The promotion that surrounds itself from the ketum’s persona instead of focusing more towards the members didn’t make it any better to entice other groups to join them other than the vibe of an opposition or the leader’s former status being a former Demokrat head of the party. Public perception had been pretty negative towards the party, mainly due to the head of the party had a criminal record for being corrupt, with little to no support had been seen inside their social media.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-05T05:23:22.0000000+00:00","Financial Strength & Management (F):
The party did submit their campaign funds which was as big as more than 8 billion rupiah in 2024. The letter in which the party submitted detailed about a few things. To start with, they’ve conducted transparency research in the party’s funding and management, while stating that the party is clean enough to participate. Yet in their limitations, the lack of resources along with observations to measure whether the party is truly honest with their reports raise a questionable notion whether this letter passing the party out of detailed investigation or simply just receiving the reports without any other questions to it. Overall, there are no financial reports from the party which can be found about the party’s financial strength or management, with no data ever recorded about the spending on their meetings (another questionable allegation). Management wise, only basic information such as the position for a treasurer that exist inside the party.

Stability (D):
The party’s leadership is considered to be pretty stable, including with a smooth transition for chairmanship. The party was at first led by I Gede Pasek Suardika’s 2022 for one year, before the chairmanship got transferred to Anas Urbaningrum in 2023 after he got freed from jailtime. The party’s neutral stance during the election with no controversies appear for the last 3 years made the stability to be its best trait. Possibly it is what favor most of the new or small parties in the list to give them a good score. The bigger the party or the longer it lives, the more chances they will have certain events or crisis that can affect them. However, to avoid unfairness to other parties that had long existed but keeping themselves stable, the basic D tier is given to this new party until it can further prove itself to be stable by 2029 at the very least without any complications.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-05T05:23:37.8530000+00:00","Organizational Capacity (E):
The party’s organization including its ways to achieve their goals had been limited in information. They only reveal a few ways on how they’ve achieved their goals, such as gotong royong and togetherness among individuals from diverse backgrounds (though ironically, their members or leaders in positions are not really that diverse). Due to their early gameplay, their playstyle involved more about how to grow their grassroots while maintaining neutrality in high-stakes presidential contests. Organizational structures were established by PKN across 34 provinces and over 500 districts/cities to grow their grassroots while mobilizing them, prioritizing their legislative representation bit by bit. It is still too early to determine whether the party’s organization is good or not, but considering for the last 3 years, they had done nothing significant to improve their organization (along with the fact that their account and websites had been pretty inactive, not a good sign for a new party that was supposed to keep itself updated), the party is given the lower score as they had done nothing but the minimum in improving their organization. Perhaps in the future, this section can be changed tremendously.","",""
