Using a few credible sources, mainly from journals, social media and news articles, this tier list was created for the sake of some light entertainment (so take it with a grain of salt with a few discussions here and there) with sources to back a few of these results. There are a few things to be pointed out before continuing the tier list:
-    Most of the political parties originated from the Reformation Era with a few exceptions for those that are still alive until this day. Old political parties that had been defunct or erased before Reformation Era will not be included (just a few clarifications)
-    Regional parties such as the Acehnese political parties won’t be counted due to their special privileges, making them an exception for regional legislatures representatives. 
-    This tier list will only cover parties that are represented in national and regional legislatures. 
-    Documents and even social media accounts of these parties will also be seen in order to further add more materials to observe, including the explanation of their agendas, programs, etc. Political party websites would also be included to add the credibility of certain analysis.","",""

Challenges in the process of making the tier list itself came with a few points to consider for the credibility of the tier list:
-    Lack of financial records from the parties, as most parties tend to not report or commonly miscalculated their own budgets. Whether it is for campaign funds or their own programs.
-    Inactive websites or links that are not working for a few cases to further analyze the party’s programs and progress.
-    Due to no primary datas to support the tier list, there are no guarantees that this political tier list will be an absolute credible source to rate the political parties in Indonesia. Furthermore, changes by the next year or even by 2029 could make this tier list had to be changed or updated in order to follow up the events that might impacted these parties’ scores.","",""

1.    Electoral strength
Measuring the voting turnout and seats won, showing the party’s influence and public support. This section usually shows 
2.    Internal governance
Assessing the governance of the party, including its decision-making processes, institutional structure, and the transparency in conducting the democratic governance.
3.    Policy & program coherence
Clear policies and programs that address the public needs, along with its implementation on the field.
4.    Outreach & inclusiveness 
Measuring the engagement with members, voters, stakeholders, and inclusion of diverse groups.
5.    Financial strength & management
Funds that the party gathered, spend and manage with its transparency.
6.    Stability
Seeing the steadiness and reliability of the party inside the political environment.
7.    Organizational capacity
Observing how structured and managed the party is to achieve its goals.

The tier list will be separated into 7 categories (F to S) for the scores for each core measurements, before finally be sum up to make the total average score for the political party in general.","",""

"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-09T06:02:33.3630000+00:00","Brief History:
Established in 2021, the party gained its origin due to Amien Rais, a former chairman for PAN’s advisory board, left the party due to an internal rift regarding support for Jokowi’s presidency. The party become an attractive option for many populist and right-wing Islamist members to join in, with several allegations being thrown at the group. The most notable allegation was the capture of an Ummat’s member due to accusation of terrorism, in which the party never fired his position as a member, even defending him. Later, this incident caused a few attacks on the Ummat’s reputation, including the following allegation that claimed the party is a terrorist organization in disguise. No significant achievements were recorded for the party other than in 2024, where they got only multiple seats for city/regency representative level. 

Electoral Strength (F):
The last election of 2024 only won the party 20 representative seats by city/regency. The party’s influence overall by representative seats are pretty minimal compared to other smaller parties. Their victories mainly reside in Padang, Bantul, Lamongan, and Jayapura city, where their candidates had been elected. This minimal influence only gave the party its best shot at collaborating with other political parties to enforce local or regional policies, with the party not being able to achieve their goals without substantial support of a coalition for their agendas.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-09T06:03:01.4860000+00:00","Internal Governance (E):
The party had been pretty roughed up due to instability and internal disputes that happened a few times. The incident happened since late 2024 to 2025, where the revised version of AD/ART (Anggaran Dasar & Anggaran Rumah Tangga) draft was disputed by Ummat’s regional party leaders due to discrepancies between the discussed draft and ratified version by Menkumham. The event caused a series of protests, with few resignations done by the provincial branch, leading to the dissolution of Ummat’s branch in Yogyakarta. Their party fortunately enough, still keeping a good showcase of their work in front of public under their current head of the party, as it seems their programs and decisions still continue regardless of the issue (or at least they managed to keep their weakness well hidden from the public). The transition of leadership itself was still stuck to top to down management, with the new general chairman: Ridho Rahmadi, is a son-in-law of Amien Rais (suggesting that the leadership is run by the family’s nepotism).

Policy & Program Coherence (D):
The party’s policies and programs are at least a bit clear than some small parties’ ideologies or agendas. They advocated for the Islamic agendas with conservative values, with several other interests that involved into making the country an Islamist state. However, in their translation inside the policies, the party became a bit contradictive due to them claiming to fight tyranny while prioritizing democracy and humanity. Their further advocacy against the Chinese presence in Indonesia became a questionable statement to their previous advocacy for humanity.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-09T06:03:05.1080000+00:00","On the other hand, they supported the idea of Jihadism but without the terrorism, then repeal to go against Omnibus Laws, agrarian reforms, social justice and other left-wing policies inside the country. This anti-capitalist but also anti-left behavior left their agendas or policies to be questioned by experts regarding their true alignment. This resulted to their ranking not being C but instead D due to this confusion, with the only thing that is consistent about the party is the Islamist conservative agenda.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-09T06:03:23.8910000+00:00","Outreach & Inclusiveness (E):
Their party’s intention is very clear: they want to recruit Muslim populace to join their sides. Particularly the right-wing populist religious groups, the party had been recruited notable figures that advocated for populist or Islamist agendas. Yet this approach limited them to only recruiting only Islamic populist groups or those that believe in the Islamic right-wing agendas. Inclusiveness for other groups cannot be seen as a result with no minorities can be spotted from the party’s program nor membership. Due to this, they had succeeded in recruiting conservative groups, but limited themselves to reach other religious groups or left-wing people. Sometimes, they do get some positive reactions from the public due to their “opposition” vibe against figures like Jokowi, Prabowo, etc but only momentarily.

Financial Strength & Management (E):
Their last campaign funds were stated to be more than 11 billion rupiah back in 2024, with a few reports about the misconduct done by the party. The party’s financial strength can at least be described to be quite moderate for a small political party, though smaller than most smaller parties with small representations inside the provincial or city offices. However, some speculations might suggest that Ummat party has a way bigger funds from the individual donations or party members’ funds to it considering they are able to afford their own buildings for conference along with meetings. This financial obscurity unfortunately put them in a lower tier until they can prove their management and transparency to be clear enough.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-09T06:03:51.1660000+00:00","Stability (F):
The internal stability of the party is currently disputed after the recent last year event that is still continuing until this day. With no proper solution nor arrangements on how to handle the crisis, suffice to say the stability of the party is threatened with the regional and central’s agreement for the party’s AD/ART. Unfortunately, even with the party’s effort to hide it with their own programs and meetings still didn’t generate enough fruitions to increase this trait. For now, the compromise made by the party is to install a new head of the party Ridho Rahmadi in order to handle the crisis with the reliability of this party still put under question on whether they can unite their opinions together to make a breakthrough. 

Organizational capacity (F):
The organization of the Ummat party had been hampered by the recent event where their regional and central branch cannot conduct themselves properly (though without this event, their organizational capacity supposedly at the level of being moderate). Their mobilization can still happen, along with the growth of grassroots but limited by the coordination between the regional and central branches. The resignations along with protests that followed from 2024 to 2025 didn’t help their case to have a greater organizational capacity. Until they can finally resolve the matter to recover themselves, the organizational capacity trait is at the bottom of the scores.","",""
