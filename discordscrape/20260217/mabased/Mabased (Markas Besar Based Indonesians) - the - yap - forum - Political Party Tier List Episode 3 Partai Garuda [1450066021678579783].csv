For the last decade, there had been significant advances or declines within various Indonesian political parties. Using a few credible sources, mainly from journals, social media and news articles, this tier list was created for the sake of some light entertainment (so take it with a grain of salt with a few discussions here and there) with sources to back a few of these results. There are a few things to be pointed out before continuing the tier list:
-    Most of the political parties originated from the Reformation Era with a few exceptions for those that are still alive until this day. Old political parties that had been defunct or erased before Reformation Era will not be included (just a few clarifications)
-    Regional parties such as the Acehnese political parties won’t be counted due to their special privileges, making them an exception for regional legislatures representatives. 
-    This tier list will only cover parties that are represented in national and regional legislatures. 
-    Documents and even social media accounts of these parties will also be seen in order to further add more materials to observe, including the explanation of their agendas, programs, etc. Political party websites would also be included to add the credibility of certain analysis.
-    The analysis of these political parties mainly lacks in gathering the primary sources from the field, as it is heavily dependent on secondary sources gathered from digital footprints or sources.","","noted (2)"

-    Lack of financial records from the parties, as most parties tend to not report or commonly miscalculated their own budgets. Whether it is for campaign funds or their own programs.
-    Inactive websites or links that are not working for a few cases to further analyze the party’s programs and progress.
-    Due to no primary datas to support the tier list, there are no guarantees that this political tier list will be an absolute credible source to rate the political parties in Indonesia. Furthermore, changes by the next year or even by 2029 could make this tier list had to be changed or updated in order to follow up the events that might impacted these parties’ scores. 
Furthermore, there are 7 core measurements in order to establish whether a political party is an effective political party:
1.    Electoral strength
Measuring the voting turnout and seats won, showing the party’s influence and public support. This section usually shows 
2.    Internal governance
Assessing the governance of the party, including its decision-making processes, institutional structure, and the transparency in conducting the democratic governance.
3.    Policy & program coherence
Clear policies and programs that address the public needs, along with its implementation on the field.
4.    Outreach & inclusiveness 
Measuring the engagement with members, voters, stakeholders, and inclusion of diverse groups.
5.    Financial strength & management
Funds that the party gathered, spend and manage with its transparency.
6.    Stability
Seeing the steadiness and reliability of the party inside the political environment.
7.    Organizational capacity
Observing how structured and managed the party is to achieve its goals.","",""

"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-15T10:06:59.6320000+00:00","Brief History:
Originally founded in 2007, the party used to be named as Partai Kerakyatan Nasional (PKN). The original founder, Harmoko, run the party in order to make a place inside the DPR but failed in 2008. Ever since then, the party was never heard of again until by 2015, when the party was unofficially been deactivated for so long: it is reorganized under the Ahmad Ridha Sabana’s leadership. Being a former Gerindra member himself, he painted the party to run for 2019 election, which got the party 33 seats for DPRD positions. However, in 2024 election, their achievements declined with only 23 seats from DPRD positions were gained from their campaign.

Electoral Strength (F):
The election in 2024 only gave them lesser seats available in DPRD than before, a decline that put Garuda into a dire situation. Most of the seats were gained in Highland Papua, parts of Maluku, and some parts in Sumatera such as South Nias, Mentawai Islands, etc. These declines made them unable to make any huge impact legislative wise if not for collaborating with Nasdem, Perindo, etc. Right now, they haven’t even made any substantial changes which put them in one of the lowest positions for this section.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-15T10:07:17.2760000+00:00","Internal Governance (E):
There is a chance that the party followed some resemblance to Gerindra way of governance, which relied on top to down leadership. This was due to the current head of the party (Ahmad Ridha Sabana) was a former Gerindra member along with his family background. Other usual structures such as Dewan Pembina, DPP, DPD, DPC and PAC can be spotted inside the party which fulfilled the minimum requirement for internal structure. Despite the formal structures, shortcoming events were reported where local branches accused of opaque, undemocratic processes by Zacarias Heriando Siku, the Vice Head of DPC from Garuda in Sikka. Rumors about Gerindra affiliation, funding from Cendana, along with other set of controversies made the rating for this section to be hampered to only the minimum score of E. Other than that, the party still operate in its formal structure, either by design that went on as usual or there are a few things that were hidden from the public, lacking transparency in showing how the party truly operates. 

Policy & Program Coherence (F):
The party’s policy and programs by far can be described to be vague and inconsistent. The party advocated their ideology to be all about nationalism and patriotism towards the country, but failed to translate these concepts into their policies to be coherent enough. There are no policies proposed by them to be proving any significant grounds or distinct features that can make them having a higher score in this section. For now, they are focusing on local issues, but failed to resonate with their national goals while appear underdeveloped.","",""

The party’s outreach tried its best in order to make the party an inclusive one. Their main recruitments nowadays focused more into the youth, calling themselves Garuda as a Youth Party. The party possibly employed one of the bold moves in politics to made 500 candidates mainly from youth groups (millennials & Gen Z), instead of relying old or influential figures like other parties usually do. Local figures and regional networks especially in eastern parts of Indonesia were used extensively to realize the goal of reaching out for the youths. Yet, in the effort of doing so, they didn’t receive much success as other parties that practiced their resonation with their own youth programs like PSI, Nasdem, etc. As a matter of fact, not many youths even resonate that much with Garuda itself, thus undermining the true goal of wanting to create a party that specialized on their youth members. Regardless, the memberships of the party are filled with many youth members, which at some point did fulfill their goals.

Financial Strength & Management (F): 
Again, the problem with all of these budgeting reports and management was that the lack of transparency. Even during 2024, the effort to determine the transparency and truthfulness behind the financial reports from the political parties were limited at best in their success. For Garuda party, it can be assumed that their party budgets are currently moderate as from their last budget report, they poured out about 11.297.043.085 Rupiah for their political campaign. The lack of presence in their social media when it comes to formal meetings or conferences suggested that they may have been more limited in their fundings.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-15T10:07:41.1970000+00:00","Management of these fundings have been kept a secret with no financial reports suggested the specifics as the investigations had been limited in results by nothing more but the reports that the party had given during registration processes. Combined with the rumor of their funding from the Cendana, this created the lowest score for the section until the party can disclose their own budget and financial management information.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-12-15T10:07:58.2690000+00:00","Stability (D): 
Their strongest suit, perhaps lies in their stability. For years, the party managed to keep itself safe from any disputes that are devastating enough. There was a controversy that threaten the stability of the party such as the allegation that Sabana assaulted a local artist though it got settled fairly quickly in 2017 by private (not sure if it was settled fairly). Regardless, the event didn’t put any strike towards the stability of the party. As a matter of fact, the party has gone long enough without any serious allegations that affect the stability. There were a few other possible controversies such as favoritism in choosing local leaders, but it didn’t cause an effect large enough to compromise the stability. Thus, for a party that had been reorganized in 2015, it put them into D tier for not having any serious instability for the past decade.

Organizational Capacity (F):
Yet again, due to the possibility of limited funding along with controversy in organizing their mobilization, their organizational capacity hasn’t been doing the best as it is. Their coordination and resource efficiency seem weak, given repeated failure to scale nationally in local elections. For a party that has been playing for 10 years, it can be considered to be very lacking in stepping up its game for better organization. Nowadays, their efforts to organize or rally the people stuck within their own social medias with clips of podcasts or videos for certain events. Mobilization wise, they barely even seen to be doing anything.","",""
