Yet to tell the truth, political violence had been a normal tool that even early modern democracy couldn't prevent nor counter back in the day. One could even argue that they are even allowed in some cases until by the modern 20th century, it had sharply declined after WW2 had been over. There are a various reasons for that and suffice to say, a long history of it along with its ideas.","",""

Previously before all of this began, the political violence had technically begun with Pompey and Caesar rivalry that turned into a full blown civil war. But what makes the assassination much more famous as a form of political violence is the motive behind it. Brutus, Cassius and the other senators believed that Caesar had recently gained more power and influence, so much so that they started to believe that he was a tyrant himself, or at least potentially to become one in the future. This is the first thing we can address: motive. According to Thomas Hobbes, a famous 17th century English political philosopher, violence is considered to be a social utility. In his arguments explaining about the state of nature and social contract, he describes that the state of nature as ""state of war against all."" 

Without a central authority, individuals are led in state of fear and violence. Thus individuals decided to form a social contract by willingly unite as a community that formed a society to protect themselves. Generally speaking, humans are rational creatures, therefore they will avoid violence by becoming a part of society to ensure their collective security. There are three main causes of conflict in the state of nature according to Hobbes: (1) rivalry, (2) distrust, and (3) pride or glory. Caesar's assassination was done when the senates suspected he will take more power and eventually making himself a dictator over the senates (thus there is a rivalry). The senates didn't believe Caesar even when before he was assassinated, he refused to even want to become a King of the Romans (distrust).","",""

These three things formulated into a famous political assassination and violence that many had remembered in their history book.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354352960708022332/Death_of_Julius_Caesar_2.png?ex=69960fbc&is=6994be3c&hm=96a7f3f3fe7be90489b9dbd66654ee74adcf317b6782423c2f652fd444ae883a&",""

This is fairly true in the cases of a few contexts. I would take the state of Holy Roman Empire, French fiefdoms and Italian States to be the perfect cases for it during Early to High Medieval era. Nobles allied or break their alliances fairly quickly, with political marriages prospered under the notion for succession, disputes, or alliances. Even the King, who was supposed to be the ruler of the state or realm, tend to most of the time, wasn't able to enforce centralization without proper administration or some violent risks that could come with it, since they had to represented the nobility's demand and wants. Rivalry over resources & lands, distrust of the others, and the matter of pride and glory that caused a few to enact duels or single combats to settled their matters. These are all the causes to political violence to flourish during this era, even normalized under jurisdictions. The Crusades and Mongol invasions were also products of political violence, but as a larger scale of it.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354353227004383323/two-armored-medieval-knights-fighting-with-swords-battle-of-armed-warrior-soldiers-killing.png?ex=69960ffb&is=6994be7b&hm=9cf43aa29d301cdb7d1c910b502d70997710bc446b36b87279f155b208bbd34d&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354353227398774864/main-qimg-5dfb80f07c0481b4eb187009afcb2494-lq.png?ex=69960ffc&is=6994be7c&hm=423922343092dbdc031f66a94c21b170c1088097d4c08624ca82e2859cf8e13c&",""

But how do we even reached the point of 1920's, where political factions do violence against each other with terror attacks? This is where we have to see further developments during the 18th to 19th century. The Renaissance, Treaty of Westphalia along with printing press had given way for these ideas to be formed not only through a specific political interest in certain country, monarch or elites, but increasingly as we more revolutionary movements. American Revolution, French Revolution, Haiti Revolution, etc are the start of how political violence became not only prominent for a more idealistic cause, but more innovations.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354353650809569390/bigtercio-1200x640.png?ex=69961061&is=6994bee1&hm=a5c614dbed992512007a12edd04ab04a63dd3665e5d0b339882c9bf828f86511&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354353651195318274/Battle-of-Edgehill-Warwickshire-October-23-1642.png?ex=69961061&is=6994bee1&hm=916094f78bf48a16cc5d81dfed46a4f6aff8bb0e6dbeae79710524a4ed77a17e&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354353651539513405/Battle_of_Vertieres_in_1803_Haitian_Revolution.png?ex=69961061&is=6994bee1&hm=1f4e173914937c6dd99bbda650557e1161b9ca4531c464f8e5eafd996be7be1e&",""

After WW1 was over, political violence and tensions still blowed up everywhere. Many nations, once had protected their monarchy, now had to resort into compromising or abandoning their long withheld monarchy system in favor for a republican ideals. Some even fell deeper into a revolution as we seen in Russian Revolution which marked even more political violence and mayhems in the early 20th century. This is where the terrorism done by the fascist groups in Italy become a product of its time. Terrorism according to Paul Wilkinson, is considered a product of 19th century revolutionary politics. Started from the ""Reign of Terror"" in France, the methods are further sharpened by the birth of its modern form. Started from 1850's to 1890's, the Irish Republican Brotherhood were considered to be the first group who enacted modern techniques of terrorism with the usage of dynamites. Another early terrorist-type group came from Russia by the early socialists. Later on in 1920, Leon Trotsky himself wrote ""Terrorism and Communism,"" to which he justify the idea of Red Terror as a moral superiority for revolutionary terrorism.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354354336490193047/red-terror-639684_16x9.png?ex=69961104&is=6994bf84&hm=2fa908d58208f43c81b6df7b7ed62952eb15f71c97c003ad6b41e9900e3c7291&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1354352710266388490/1354354337190772827/220px-Mulcahy2C_Clarke_Luby2Cand_OE28099Leary2C_circa_1880s.png?ex=69961104&is=6994bf84&hm=76e4434172dc3854121f86f13165cc3c59576261ebf2813870e1330f50380d93&",""
