I'm not that all knowing, I just follow the awesome and well written story that's all. What's Project Moon you may ask? Well, it's an Indie company from korea and they make games. The most popular one currently is Limbus Company, it's a gatcha game but feels like it is not a gatcha game. Curious? You should! It's well written and has character development. You can ask anything about the PM universe from me with my current knowledge. GLORY TO KIM JIHOON!","",""
