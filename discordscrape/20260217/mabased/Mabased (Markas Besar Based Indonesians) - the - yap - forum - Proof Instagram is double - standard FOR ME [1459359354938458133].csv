1. A person on this server sent a screenshot of a twitter post
2. You read the text from that post
3. You get so frustrated about it that it ruined your day and you decided to vent about it

Did you notice how riled up you were from just an image on discord? Have you ever thought about why you decided to vent about it? Do you not think that it is a waste of time to vent about this?

> But listen bruh i hate paying because im poor+scared if my money was used to fund IDF
> Im dissing the corpo side
> Look at Netflix
> Duit banyak
> Tapi show bagusnya di cancell
> Chrunchyroll
> Using an Israeli software

Did you notice that the original twitter post never once mentioned anime-related things? It only talked about reading unofficially translated manhwa.

Let's assume that if you decided to pay Netflix/Crunchyroll, your money would 100% be used to fund the IDF, would complaining about it change anything? You yourself know that there are better ways to support the creators, so why not just do that? Do you not regret spending so much time thinking about things you have no control over?

> Thats why i pirated 
> Please i want yall to approve me this

Did you notice that you are trying to get other people's approval on your opinion? Why is there a need to be ""approved by other people""? Does that change anything about your life? Does it automatically justify you deciding to pirate anime & manga?","",""

What emotions are you feeling?
What part of that thing makes you emotional? 

Afterwards, ask yourself whether or not taking action based on that emotion is helpful or not. Most things in life are not worth worrying over. There are better things to spend your time on","","👑 (2)"

I won't fuel your confirmation bias, simply said Anak SMA is anak SMA, They're in high schools and aged 15-20, but know that the label of anak SMA and it's usage in a derogatory sense *rarely* applies to everyone *all at once*, what's the context that made you end up asking about Anak SMA?

A trope of something doesn't mean someone who belongs to that trope necessarily and religiously can be defined by said Trope. 

But honestly, calling anak SMA a trope is wrong, they can be a trope, but don't apply it to real life conditions, because anak SMA is simply a categorization associated with one's current education level and/or age. I advise you to not think in a ""If A is B, then A is C"" mindset. 

Then, HP itu harus dikumpulkan karena — supporting Rawon's stake, they are a distraction. You came to school to learn and be properly educated, not to have meaningless fun you can either way do outside school.

You know what social media can do to you, that + having a developing brain, paired with hormones can quite be the combo to make one's mind oscillating needlessly by outside factors and things happening around them. 

Simply said, teenagers have less resistance against unstable or unreliable flow of information and is easily affected by it, even amplified. 

Lastly, confiscation doesn't exist to just torture you, or control you JUST BECAUSE or JUST FOR THE SAKE OF IT, it's NOT simply they want to control you, they're not as simple as that, they have a function and meaning why it has to be adhered, or advised to uphold. 

It's good that you ask them here where adults answer you earnestly, but please do appreciate the time and thoughts they shed for you by properly reading and processing them too.

Hope you find this helpful Tian","",""

Highschoolers are teenagers who are mostly in their 15-18, they are teens who are in the realm of self discovery but they are still rather immature (not in a derogatorive sense) in one way or another (prefrontal cortex is still in development), your emotional control, logic and emotional management isnt fully developed for the average teen, the hormones that contribute to the unstable mind and because of the setup for mid teens compared to late teens bcs of the much less developed mind, the world slowly exposes them to real life events, case in point, college freshman has access to a whole new world compared to highschool sophmores.

whilst i disagree that 18 is an adult age, it is an age where you are somewhat developed to be able to be exposed to real life affairs and responsibilities because of the afformentioned, but as kikkou said, they are much less resistant towards unstable and unreliable flow of information, and they are not in that stage to be able to comprehend, rationalize, and manage their irrational side : case in point ; alot of teens advocate for ACAB simply because of that gojek driver getting runned over, the emotional rage sparked the movement where they generalize because of the numerous cases of oknum cops, whilst not every teen falls under this classification, **THE AVERAGE** does  

your phone getting confiscated is **_under the assumption of the proper and functioning education system to adhere to the goals of the school_**, whilst myself also disagree with how some of the rules are implemented (especially hair rules) and  education system in indo is intergrated where in short ; its ineffective for students to learn and study there. you are there to learn and socialize, not play, and **rules exist for a reason, whether if its good or not**","",""

i understand what you're feeling, and i understand the frustration as i was there before, but again, everything happens for a reason and _In my opinion_, its best to actually spend some time off and make memories being in school (socializing)  g
