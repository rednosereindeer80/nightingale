# PAST Threats

We might be used to news about Data Breach and Leaks from Companies (Especially our PDN circa 2024).

We might also be used to how ransomeware gang operate where they lock your computer, encrypt your data, and asked for monies to open it circa 2010s.

Nowadays, these are no longer how majority of them operate.  What they did was exploiting known vulnerability on software which was prevented alot in recent years - you could see this from how often your OS/Softwares asked for updates.","",""

Do you often download your favorite games' mods and cracked softwares scattered in the internet?

You are at risk more than ever.

What these bad guys do now is slipping a variant of malware called info-stealers into these game mods and pirated software.

## How Infostealer works

Unlike ransomware or other classic malwares, that give away silly pop-up or make you provide access to these hackers, these infostealers are silent.

They silently steal your credentials saved in your browsers, text files, important docs, xls, etc.

What they need is just one time install and thats it they have everything.

And what is crazy is these little sweet stuff called cookie stored in your browser and applications. They just need this session cookie and impersonate you WITHOUT even the need for 2FA straight on their browser.","",""

- NEVER tell Browser to remember your password, 
- ALWAYS verify any LINK and File you receive from somebody else,
- DO NOT install mods, illegal software and Browser Extensions unless you do your homework to validate if it is safe (disassemble it? Lol)","",""

The number of these threat actors will only be increasing. It is easier more than ever to hack people. The new waves of threat actors we have now are e-gangsters turned hackers. These kids usually buy malwares and spread it to steal our credentials and sell them.

For kids who think to be a hacker. You might heard hackers arrested and hired by CIA in the past. Now, it is no longer happening. Most likely you will only be a part of e-gangster buying these malwares or stolen credentials to attack people and companies. CIAs do not need this kind of kids, so you will only be thrown STRAIGHT TO JAIL.","",""
