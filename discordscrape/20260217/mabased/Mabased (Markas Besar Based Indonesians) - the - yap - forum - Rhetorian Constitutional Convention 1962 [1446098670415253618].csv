The country enjoys its new found independence, however a constitution has yet to be established. It is now up to the delegates of the constitutional convention (you) to determine the future of Rhetoria.

*thought experiment on how this server would make an ideal constitution*
Delegates of this convention will vote on polls and can make their own polls. Feel free to roleplay as any political position.

Overview
- Rhetoria is dominated by the Rhetorian ethnic group whom have developed a strong cultural identity although this is concerning to minorities in the nation.
- Ragnic companies dominate Rhetoria's economy.
- Rhetoria has a pretty bad track record of workers rights.
- Rhetoria is deeply divided by religion with the Dast v. Nurist rivalry culminating in violent clashes outside of cities.
- Rhetoria is fair game for the superpowers of capitalism and communism.
- The aftermath of the referendum left Rhetoria in a power vacuum.","",""

The Rhetorian Military is made up of several revolutionary militias and regional defense organizations combined into one.

There are a few schools of thought to this.

❓ **Ignore** We will not interfere with the political thoughts of the military.

- *May Pork* of the *Pork Party* with *39% of the vote*
