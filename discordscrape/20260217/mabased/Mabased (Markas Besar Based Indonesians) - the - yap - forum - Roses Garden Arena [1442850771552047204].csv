Dewan akan mengambil *penyadang disabilitas* sebagai metrik penentuan apakah semua transportasi umum di Jakarta pada saat ini memenuhi standar.

Dengan asumsi:
Transportasi Umum = { MRT, LRT, TransJakarta, JakLingko }

Untuk transportasi umum di Jakarta dianggap **memenuhi standar**, setiap stasiun/halte harus memenuhi kriteria berikut:
> Setiap penumpang penyadang disabilitas dapat pergi dari stasiun/halte A ke stasiun/halte B dan menggunakan seluruh fasilitas utama selayaknya penumpang tanpa disabilitas.

Beberapa bukti menunjukkan bahwa tidak semua stasiun & halte memenuhi kriteria ini:
- Masih terdapat stasiun yang tidak ramah penumpang disabilitas
https://www.tvonenews.com/channel/news/334707-penampakan-halte-jalur-langit-transjakarta-tak-ramah-penumpang-disabilitas

// comment
Very sad I'm not able to find data on the ramp slope of all the public transport facilities in Jakarta.

According to the ADA Standards, the maximum slope for ramps is 1:12 (~4.8°). Not sure what the standard is for Indonesia.
Ref: https://www.access-board.gov/ada/guides/chapter-4-ramps-and-curb-ramps/

I am absolutely certain most ramps in TJ stations are above 4.8° in Jakarta, but I'm too socially anxious to actually go and measure them myself.

JakLingko is even worse, but I can't find news report on it and I don't want to manually verify the JakLingko stops

No, it should not. Using calculative logic and emotional arguments, there is no reason for patriarchy to exist in the modern era. It is an inefficient way to distribute manpower with no strong backing, as a violent-dominated world has been replaced by a bureaucratic one and is no longer ruled by strength.

Calculative:

It is more manpower efficient that women to be a productive member of society, as halving their own manpower potential just because of a role that is no longer as demanding as 200 years ago, without the female workforce, it will be considerably harder to meet industrial demand for workforce, not to mention the bureaucratic toll and need for a literate part of society to be able to crunch number and data is expensive when it comes to human capital. 

Not to mention the foolishness of rejecting 50% of potentially talented human resources to be manifested into an excessively talent-draining role within society, as such, the inclusiveness of the female gender within the structural power of society and filling intensive capital of human resources, both in terms of quantitative and qualitative, is logical and should not be hampered for the advancement of society both on an economic and social lens.

Emotional: 

Bruh, my mum can make you cry with just a glare, and you think you are superior to her 🤨🤨

so no, there is no place for a patriarchy in a modern setting. But strangely enough, I do support the idea that men must act courteously toward women and treat them with gentleness, even though they are strong without us.","",""

I guess it should stay. No offense, but biologically women will always need time to focus on raising her kids whenever she is pregnant and give birth.

Simply patriarchy allows the society to be more efficient, than otherwise - so it is okay for me rather than all societies in the world embracing matriarchy.","",""

Permanent members hold their seats indefinitely rather and they possess veto power, meaning they can block the adoption of any substantive Security Council resolution regardless of the level of support from other members. This status gives permanent members a uniquely influential role in decisions relating to sanctions, peacekeeping operations, military intervention, and the recognition of threats to international peace.

There is still a consideration regarding a rule about being related so there is always risk when taking an opportunity, which usually involves removing their status from the UN security council. They're contemplating the substance due to the intentions of the insider who knows about this. It's getting harder and involves factions with different arguments and bad ideas. I don't think it's just a risk concerning their previous agreement. Therefore, there is still an appeal from international media and social media to find out about this. 

Removing permanent membership status is not the only solution to resolve the issue, it also gives the council a chance to consider other perspectives while exploring topics they can observe.

Just to simplify my answer, I hope this can be understood.","","💯 (1)"
