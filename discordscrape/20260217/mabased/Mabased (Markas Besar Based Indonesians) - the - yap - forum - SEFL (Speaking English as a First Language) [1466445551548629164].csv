I'm one of the very early individuals in the country who speaks English as a first language outside of the upper class (even within the upper class it's still pretty rare).

I had a turbulent early childhood because of it. I couldn't mingle with kids around my kindergarten and they often left me alone. But whenever they didn't, they would physically bully me as some sort of game. Maybe they thought I was this weird foreigner kid who needs a little lesson on how to be tough. Needless to say, that experience even affected the way I grew up.

It's a miracle I could pick up Bahasa Melayu so easily. I managed to gain a lot of friends both in elementary school and in highschool partly because of it. It's a crying shame that I didn't pick up their languages but I feel like things would've been very different if I did.

But that was years ago.

As I grew up, I started to see more and more kids who grew up like me. A monolingual English speaker. In a country where only 60% of the population speaks it to some degree. While these kids probably live healthy childhoods, something about it makes me deeply uncomfortable.

Borderline traumatic.
But what is it?
What is this sudden spike of anxiety I'm feeling?
Harkening back to a long gone past?
How the f--k should I feel about this?
**Why is English the only language they know?**","",""

Unlike me, he never got fluent in Malay and speaks exclusively English all his life.
Even more surprising is that he went to a Chinese school and *still* didn't bother to learn Mandarin.

Man I f--king hate him so much I could puke all over his bed","",""
