I can recommend only these two shoes because I personally use it selama aku intern di rumah sakit, and if you ask any med students, that line of work involves a lot of walking and standing

1. Kanky Hiro Musashi, sekilas mirip Yeezys, I know, but the comfort you get for not even 300k is great, I daily drive these bad boys for its comfort while standing and walking

2. Ortuseight Brisbane, even better but the price is 500k iirc, I personally don't like the style though and for standing for long periods of time, Kanky is the better choice. But it's much better for walking","",""
