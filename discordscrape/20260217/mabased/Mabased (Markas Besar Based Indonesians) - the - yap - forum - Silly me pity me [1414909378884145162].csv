Try to ignore argue and mostly just ranting out on my social media stories, but no one seems care like did anybody does, I don't know where should I lash it out to which direction, 
Ohh I had certain difabled condition, I had low vision, I can't use glasses, I can't see like 3 cm away clearly, thats my line of sight, and of course I wouldn't dare ride motorcycle in highway, mostly I read the enviroment by see what I can see with these blurry vision and deduct and imagine and assumed and oversimplified all of those then act accordingly, and yeah I guess thats the reason I didn't get a job.
Previously I work as customer service working in office which is faraway, most of my salary is spend on transport by gojek.
And at job, well honestly my ablity for misreading the situation is really help me getting kicked out from the office.
I still live with my parents and my parents do understand my condition, but yeah they are so conservative as long I sholat 5 waktu they give me 100k a week, and here I am, without mentor or someone to direct me, without even money to move and find opportunity, I didn't know what I am supposed to do, still try find a job, while sometimes i just got drown by addiction scrolling 6 hours, huh, yeah I still try to get away from this addiction like excercise listening podcast finishing game that I bought months ago, I hangout with friend but they just didn't really care, well they had their own problem.
Sorry maybe I sound so overdramatic and so defensive, and yeah mostly I misunderstood by my current enviroments and I had some kind of intended to correct anythig and avoid being yelling out, but sorry I was too much yapping, I just doesn't know where should I pointing out my heart.","",""

I have no problem having my soul drained sitting at a desk or stacking heavy boxes onto pallets for over 12 hours a day but having to deal with being accused of shit I didn't do is insufferable","",""

"479248434688163841","ayasdwiky","2025-09-09T10:57:23.2140000+00:00","Thanks to my previous jobs, which is the first time I work at Office, unlik my previous job when I just store clerk or at cafe, ""pretend to look busy"" is also part of the jobdesk, I where I must stand by for 8 hours as customer service is my main job, but sometimes they give me some small task like data input, report, daily luggages checklist which is reasonable and I Just finish it for 2-3 hours. 
But my colleague always told me to not finish it so early, but I just bored and sometimes finish their work too, well honestly I am uncomfortable being surrounded by many people while I have nothing to do, so sometimes I just going out like my senior smoking outside but it just only few minutes,  while the others is like pretend to be busy and gossiping, 
And sometimes I put headset and listening some audiobook or podcast. 
I never knew that in the office politics is much worst than jobs in field, I though I was safe as long I get the jobs done, but nah, somehow I got tangled in some silly drama that was nothing to do with me. And I just doesn't know that somehow I got kicked out, just because the manager doesn't like me when I had talk with the owner since the owner is from America and I can speak english while manager couldn't, that was I heard from my senior when I got kicked out weeks later. 
It was too fast like wtf. 
Well it's not like I love or hate the jobs, I just want to work and get some money.","",""
