Our language, the thing we have duty to maintain and guard against the progress of time, is slipping away from our grasp like loose sand in our hand.

We do not have a mold to cement them into something corporeal that can be the axis of our language saga and journey. No great figure like Shakespeare and tolkien to be coveted, to be look upon with envy and reverence, no epic and sagas that is formed by the culture we have. 

Our classes just stand empty, never highlighting with great concise the figure within our literature to be taught as example for our students to learn form. 

What is a structure for a language if it's garden is desolate without life. 

A great tragedy for our nation","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353181020568158241/1353181131729797150/images_10.jpg?ex=699669a2&is=69951822&hm=31922b2cf7e325105d4eb7b02759c84a2afecb9d80c833919bfeff4f128b825b&","😿 (1)"

Our bookshelves gather dust while our eyes gleam at headlines, and they never linger long enough to even absorb the ideas to the depth of thought. The world no longer reads; it scrolls. Reading has never been a deeply ingrained habit amongst Indonesia's populace, and thus this decline is even more apparent.

Towering figure--Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Tolkien--have shaped English into what it is today. But our language lacks widely celebrated literary icons who praise its essence. Pramoedya, Sapardi, Chairil Anwar, these names remain unsung and not given the recognition they deserve. Our classrooms do not echo with their words, and so the students move on, unaware of the giants that walked before them, and even among them.

Perhaps this is simply the reality of our time. A world too fast, too fleeting, where the beauty of language is lost in the rush of information. But if a language is to endure beyond function--if it is to be more than just a means of speech--it must have its champions, its poets, its visionaries.","",""

The minds and the life of our people could fill the largest libraries in the world and yet it won't be enough. To look upon the state of our language, our literature, is to look upon a desolate place while a verdant garden is maintained and cherished next to you.

Great envy has already risen within me everytime i see how they, our enemies and foes, has been the gardener of their own roots, while we, famished with nothing to harvest.

In the words they write, they carve a shard of their very soul into the thin paper. In every sentence a emotion, feeling, frozen in time. A memory, a window into their minds. Each letter piercing our skulls, painting a sight greater than what our eyes can see.

But rose that morn a blighted sun whose light scoured like a flood
The sky was rent asunder and the rivers turned to blood
Their flesh peeled off in sickly strips, their bones were rendered bare
And still they chanted ever on, the words they uttered there
Until bone and flesh and earth and death were all forgotten things
And still unbidden, undesired, the blackened spire sings
