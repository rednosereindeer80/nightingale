This release provides temporary relief, but ignores and sustains the root issue, creating a violent and destructive cycle of buildup and catharsis.
This issue is the root cause of many things, such as seniority, tawuran, bullying, twitter flaming, etc.
I recognise that this issue also occurs in other countries with shitty societies, like Korea and Japan, but as I currently live in Indonesia, I wish to discuss it as it occurs here.","",""
