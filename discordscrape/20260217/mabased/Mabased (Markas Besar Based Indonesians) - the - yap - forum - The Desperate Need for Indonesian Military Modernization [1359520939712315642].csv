Even with the M.E.F (Minimum Essential Force), an effort by the government started under the SBY administration has failed time and time again to meet any goals that are laid out to be accomplished under 5 years for each phase.  One of the highlights of those failures has been the Korean and Indonesian joint partnership on building and licensing Korean-designed subs (which was also a license from West German design). The military has also failed to sufficiently stockpile ammunition and Pindad has not yet finished the batch of Ammunition (in varying calibers) that was ordered by Prabowo when he was still in the defense minister's office.

 one of my biggest fear is that we have the hardware after purchasing it from foreign supplier but not having enough ammo to sustain any operational tempo in any stretch amount of time. Yes, we could convert civilian factories to churn out ammunition and armor of any kind to feed the logistical need for any possible conflicts but I have doubts that we could translate even half of our industrial output to produce defense-related equipment, that is mainly because of the nature of our industrial output is not supported by readily available heavy equipment like CNC machine and etc.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1359520939712315642/1359520940148527358/YAp_1.jpg?ex=699667ca&is=6995164a&hm=442ff439367049faec175f1c02eff7f9ef6a809b357a0b60faba67ed47f7dfac&",""
