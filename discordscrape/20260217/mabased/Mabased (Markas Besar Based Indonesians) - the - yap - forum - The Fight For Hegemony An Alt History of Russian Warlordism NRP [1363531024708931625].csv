This is where the 1992 crisis and downfall of USSR caused Russia to be splitted into many smaller states and factions, with each warlords controlled their own regions. I just wanted to retell my journey and rp stories here as I had dwelled for like a day in there. But before that, let's see the lore for it:

Lore:
On August 18, 1991, a coup attempt was launched against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev by a coalition of hardline Communist officials, military officers, and KGB leadership. The coup, orchestrated by the State Committee on the State of Emergency (GKChP), sought to prevent further political and economic liberalization, citing the instability of the union as justification. Gorbachev was placed under house arrest in Foros, Crimea, while Moscow was flooded with troops and armored vehicles.

Initially, the coup leaders controlled major state media outlets and government buildings, but their grip began to weaken almost immediately. Several regional leaders, including Boris Yeltsin in the Russian SFSR, refused to recognize their authority. Mass protests broke out in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, and other major cities. Some military units hesitated or outright refused orders, while others aligned themselves with various political factions, creating a rapidly fracturing situation.","",""

Conflicting orders were issued by different branches of the government, with some generals calling for martial law while others declared loyalty to their regional governments. Communications between different command centers broke down as competing factions seized television and radio stations to broadcast their own declarations of legitimacy. Reports emerged of entire divisions in the military defecting, with some commanders openly refusing to recognize Moscow’s authority.

On August 20, fighting erupted in Moscow. Loyalist forces attempted to storm the Russian White House, where Yeltsin and his supporters had established a resistance headquarters, but they were repelled after intense clashes. Elsewhere in the city, armed groups of police, KGB officers, and soldiers engaged in sporadic firefights as various factions vied for control. Outside of Moscow, several regions declared their independence outright, while others claimed to be the rightful government of the Soviet Union, leading to a chaotic proliferation of self-declared authorities.

By August 21, the Soviet government had effectively ceased to function as a single entity. Some members of the GKChP fled the capital, while others were arrested or killed in fighting. The military splintered, with different units following different chains of command. Some republics declared full independence, while others sought to reestablish a new Soviet authority under their own leadership. With no clear center of power, the USSR entered a period of uncontrolled fragmentation, with rival governments, military factions, and political movements all vying for dominance.","",""

- **Lore:**
Amidst USSR downfall as a proper Communist state, Japan was faced with an uncertain predicament. Previously, Japan had a cautious and complex reaction to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, shifting from a hostile posture towards a more cautious and pragmatic approach. While some in Japan initially rejoiced at the Soviet Union's collapse, there was also concern about the stability of the post-Soviet landscape and the potential for further destabilization & crisis in the region. Under Prime Minister of Japan: Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan aimed to secure the previous lands owned to them by occupying Sakhalin. A few regiments of JSDF was dispatched to secure the island under the leadership of Yasunori Morishita, Second Liutenant promoted into Commander of Sakhalin Expeditionary Force. Japan has declared itself along with South Korea, that they are the few Asian bastions that USA & other allied forces can trust to keep a good order in the Far East. With this statement, Japan had convinced America along with other allies that they need to secure influence in Far East to keep the turmoil from getting out of control. Eventually, they wished for a Russian successor state that they can relied on for further stability in Asia while repealing the Communist influences.
