Please excuse my RSF fanboying.
In short, the fireforce was a rapid-response air assault tactic, usually consisting of 3 or more gunships, responsible for carrying the 4-man sticks who are to be deployed on the ground and supporting machinegun fire, a command car, housing the commander, who will scout the area for insurgents and provide suppressing fire, and a transport plane to paradrop the before mentioned sticks, although sometimes fireforces lacked a transport plane and instead uses additional G-ships. 
Addtionally, the airships are supported by a light attack aircraft, sometimes also supported by CAS, light bombers or fighter bombers.
Fireforce heavily relied on the accuracy of the reported insurgent sightings. The fireforce could be called in by observation posts (mostly constructed by insurgent-turned RSF forces from the Selous Scouts or other branches.) or patrols, the fireforce was also dispatched in response to insurgent attacks.
The execution itself consisted of the command ship entering and verifying the targets, opening fire and sending down the G-Ships to either cut off the insurgents as they fled or to drop on the ground and form a sweepline. After the targets have been verified, paratroopers would be dropped from the transport aircraft and sweep the ground.
On the ground, the sweeplines consisted of the four man sticks, they would usually alternate fire, two covering as the two pushed forwards.
All of this resulted in a kill ratio of 1:60, sometimes 1:80. 
Fireforce was, by its core, creating 10 clones of yourself and casting fireball. Overwhelming your enemy with immense firepower, making sure none survive.","",""
