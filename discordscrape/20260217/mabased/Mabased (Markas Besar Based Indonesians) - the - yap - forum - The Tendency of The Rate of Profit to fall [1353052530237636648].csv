Have you ever heard of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall?
I think, it is in your best interest, to research or read up on it then come back
Because im interested in hearing about your counterarguments to this and why you think its flawed or straight up false.

When a company starts making good money, it attracts new businesses who want a piece of that profit. As more players enter the market, everyone has to compete harder.

In a competitive market, goods and services are easily replicated, and being competitive is most easily achieved by lowering prices.

As the market becomes more mature in the long run, it's harder to keep making big profits. But more consumers can afford the goods, increasing consumer surplus.

Overall, while producer surplus decreases, it's balanced by the increase in consumer surplus.","",""
