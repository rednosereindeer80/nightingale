Each political parties in Kota/kabupaten and provinsi have their own political dynamics which could be very different from the national level. It is best if you could be a mentee of an anggota dewan that is also within the structure of the party (Ketua, Wakil Ketua, Sekertaris, Bendahara).  

Important thing: 
1) Be clear on what is your purpose of joining. Something as small as ""I just want to network"" could be a good justification for youngsters. 

2) Be self-centric. After joining a political party, and you feel uncomfortable or being leeched, it is okay to leave. 

3) Do not join small party that do not have anggota DPR. Verifikasi is hell. And if it fails, your party cannot join election which is the sole purpose of any political party in the first place.

4) Last but not least, do not be nobody or anybody in the organization. You have to plan to be somebody and get something. Else, it will just be a waste of time.","","This (2)"

1. PDIP: the strongest grassroot party of all parties. PDIP is a good learning center if you want to focus on more grassroot gathering and supports. They have the most well equipped facilities since their offices are basically almost everywhere in provinces. They also got a lot of veteran people you can learn from, thus it is very advisable to get a connection with them. Like all big political parties, they have one of the oldest cadre school that is capable on teaching you with their guides in political maneuvering, as they can even sent you to international studies in Germany, China and Australia. The downside of joining them? They basically have too many veteran cadres, chances are without you having a connection inside the party, you would be downsided for candidancy in caleg or any local elections.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:30:12.3480000+00:00","2. Golkar: another old oligarch party, and pretty economic oriented. Their main focuses would be all about economic growth and corporatism. Keep in mind that all parties tend to act like a corporate political party, but Golkar take it up to a notch. Their parties tend to be pretty oligarchic while its institutional legacy from the New Order makes Golkar deeply embedded in bureaucracy and regional networks. They also have munas (Musyarawah Nasional) where they do held these kind of meetings daily for each year thus you can actually be invited regularly to even join their discussions. Though structured and organized, Golkar may or may not still held the old mindset, in which they entrusted the party to members like boss to his workers. The corporatism mindset can make you struggle in gaining their trusts without having good connections to begin with, thus similar result in being a potential candidate can be hard, if not even impossible (especially they also got a lot of political veterans too).","","This (1)"
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:30:40.1790000+00:00","3. Gerindra: If you prefer a strong centralized leadership under a strongman, this is for you. Structured from DPP down to DPC and PAC, their loyalty to Prabowo is a key organizing principle. Basically it make this party a bit more militaristic (for obvious reason) though they are still a party with their own mishaps too, not so different from many parties. They have the cold war mindset of advocating for nationalism, economic independence and strong leadership to further consolidating their power. Compared to Golkar and PDIP, their structures are somewhat still developing, including their cadre school. But similar issues can be faced for you if you joined Gerindra: too many veterans that can taught you but also blockade you from getting a candidacy for local office. Furthermore, PDIP, Golkar and Gerindra are the three biggest numbers in cadres for their political party, with Golkar having more than 390,000 people, while Gerindra having more than 361,000 people. Suffice to say, this party is not suited if you didn't have strong loyalty to Prabowo or good connections with the members to start with. (Agen Gerindra bisa juga cek kalau ini benar atau ada yang perlu diperbaiki)","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:30:43.1640000+00:00","4. PKB: A moderate Muslim political party that advocates for religious tolerance, rural development, and Islamic values. They got the closest connection with NU, with a decent organization and structure for a party. Their biggest advantage came in logistics and Islamic connections. They got huge connections with pesantren or Islamic cultural figures, which in return donated their logistics for PKB. Yet due to this, they relied too much on recruiting pesantren or cultural figures for their main cadres of choosing. You best have a good connection with a pesantren figure in order to get inside since they valued these figures. Moreover, though they attained a good political stability as a moderate party, their main audience for support including millennial and urban populace are lacking with the general public view for them is not doing good. Your best bet is that if you can become a millennial or urban cadre that is impactful for the party, they can use you for a selling point to the urban regions. Oh, also keep in mind their cadre school is lacking below Nasdem and PDIP, so don't expect some good political education from them.","","This (1)"
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:31:02.8100000+00:00","5.  PKS: Easily the most organized and disciplined political party in Indonesia. PKS basically achieved what PKB wishes to achieve in their support and grassroots: an organized support system in both rural and urban areas. They have a very good caderization program with not many people even have ""instant cadre"" for the candidacy competition without going through multiple political programs first. The only things lacking from them are two factors: populism and exclusivity. PKS tend to be not quite open to the public about their programs with their populist agenda is not as strong as PDIP nor other big parties to begin with. Since your parents are cadres inside this political party, you have a good chance to enter, but don't expect an instant cadre status since you have to went through multiple programs for you to be prepared as a trustworthy cadre. Logistical system mainly came from a well covered educated and rural populace both in urban and rural areas.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:31:24.4900000+00:00","6. PAN: Their approach is very pragmatic and flexible, as their cadres recruitment generally didn't get too much of a requirement since they prioritize famous or influential people lately (thus why you see them artists signing up for PAN). Yet because of this, they suffered from political opportunism and pragmatic decisions that inflict inconsistency in their party. Your best chance inside the party is whether you are a famous person, influencer along with being a businessman that brought some good money in the back for them. Their logistical support though quite decent, is not as good as PKS, PDIP, etc. They got some support from Muhammadiyah with decent connections with some members, making them a mid tier party. Their promotions however, had gotten better along with the digitalization due to them having able members to do such promotion. So there is a bit of hope that PAN can grow to be a suitable party for younger audience. 

7. Demokrat: An old player of political game, but declining ever since they are not in charge of the government since 2014. Just like PAN, they still suffer from pragmaticism and political opportunism in their party, including their cadres program. They have that elitism sense in their recruitment thus suffer in having capable young cadres for their own manpower, even a bit more suffering than Golkar and Gerindra. Even from my personal experience, they didn't bother to guide their young cadres properly other than nepo babies which is not a good news for their continuity in raising their cadres standard. Nevertheless, their connections and logistical system is still strong to moderate thanks to their long time existence. They are currently try to rebuild their grassroots for younger generations with AHY, yet still struggling in surpassing it. It is a moderate party that has a moderate power, a struggling mid tier with loyalty towards SBY as a decent central figure that has the word ""elitism"" behind his members.","",""
"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-04-13T18:31:43.5930000+00:00","8. Nasdem: Another moderate party but with actual better work than Demokrat and PKB. Their advertisement done way better than some political parties' advertisements (including the new showcase in Metro TV owned by Surya Paloh). The best cadre academy of all time if you compared them with other parties. They got ABN, the one and only corporate political university in Indonesia. They have the golden standard of political education for their members in Indonesia (even beating PDIP and Golkar) which suffice to say, if you want a good education to begin with, Nasdem is your best choice. Their leader, Surya Paloh, as much as he is an opportunistic dude, knows how to get his job done for the party to be an organized one. Even now, Nasdem is quite solid with their programs and stances of being a reformist yet also as a soft opposition for the government. Thus Nasdem is still a suitable choice for younger members to seek education while being properly guided in the political system to finally becoming a cadre for local competitions. Elitism might still exist tho since many members are ex-Golkar members.","","This (2)"

Yet it had weakened quite a lot for internal matters due to internal divisions along with vague positioning during the recent elections. Though in all fairness, being an old player, they have internal councils, youth and women's wings which made them to be a formidable party for their own internal branches (GPK, AMK, WPP). If you entered this party, you would have a regular congress meeting called Muktamar. But this is also where the rivalry began as contested leadership regularly happened in there, with top-down control exist depending on which faction took control in PPP. Most likely your agenda when playing in this party will become a supportive role on religious and moral policies. Overall, a good small party but quite unstable in its leadership.

Hanura: Well, they started in 2006 originally, but failed as a small party to gain enough relevance in the media. They were what you called as ""clean nationalist alternative"" with idealist standard to win the elections back then. But there is one problem: they never have a clear standard with their party driven by personalities than doctrine (literally a Wiranto party). History of top-down control, then mixed with recent internal splits damage the trust that they once have from the people. It is not suggested to join this party if you want to have a quick win in the elections considering they failed to adapt to voter demands along with technological trends to keep up with it.","",""

It has its own continuity and discipline thankfully within areas that have strong Islamic roots (West Sumatra, Aceh, South Sulawesi, etc). So if you are having a KTP in there, PBB is quite a decent regional option for a party. Yet it lacks in innovation, grassroots' growth, mass mobilization infrastructure, etc. It just stayed there, like a stagnant political machine that become mainly a top-down political party under Yusril. Thus the party stayed alive, but not growing for the past few years right now. It fall to the same category as Hanura with ""personality driven party"" title, with regular congress like Muktamar exist but didn't gave chances to generational leadership renewal to breakthrough huge progress in generating new figures. Their main policies are surrounded in the usage of Sharia norms in policies, though they had not taken ministerial positions for a long time.

PSI: Oh boi, where do I began with this one. This was actually a promising party that managed to gain good tractions of support. Progressive, anti-corruption, pluralist and pro-youth party, a former shining star during its own era. It is quite centralized to start with, then fall into personality-driven era during Giring Ganesha leadership before finally entering the Kaesang's era. They at least try to appeal more to the youth and millenials population, but their leadership prevent for generational new figures for the leadership, often reflected elite privileges too. Several accusations against PSI include most famously for their grandstanding stance (focusing more to media appearances than having real legislative results). Although credit is where credit is due, they have a strong social media campaign with youth-focused messaging to it (it is effective for urban youth populace).","",""

Education wise, they don't have proper school like the big parties, but their engagement and training can be translated as being ""ok"" so far.

PKPI: Another splinter faction from Golkar other than Nasdem. It was founded by a former military general and still run by another former military general, trying to provide an alternative solution to civil-military reform and moderate nationalism. However, just like other parties, they fell into ideological vagueness, then latching to other figures (*Staring at Tommy Soeharto*). Due to lack of funding along with no innovations whatsoever being made into it, suffice to say, it stuck into an even deeper hole: a political shell that can only be activated during elections, with voters barely even know what and why this party was even formed in the first place.

"412926738298044431","jaxxxxxxyyyy","2025-05-11T16:20:54.1270000+00:00","Partai Garuda: A party that tried to be like PSI but failed miserably than PSI. They speak of youth empowerment, unity, and change yet fall into a platform for political positioning and elite maneuvering. It even gain a nickname as ""phantom party"" due to the party itself lack consistent ideological narrative. It built basic and minimal elecoral infrastructure to gain votes and basic support, however for a ""youth"" party, it lacks greater grassroots activity. There are almost no organizations having ties or built by this party (not even a community). It became a top-down political party again just like other smaller parties, though very centralized under Ahmad Ridha Sabana. Thus it is not a good party to join into once more if you want greater progress from a political party.

Partai Buruh: At least a more consistent ideological party than other smaller parties. Under Said Iqbal, they operated quite decently well though many viewed this aprty as ""NGO-Style"" movement than a good electoral force. It has the advantage of being backed by 11 major labor unions and federations (KSPI, KPBI, etc). At least they are active as a semi-active network and functional one, rather than an empty shell party. The party claimed to be bottom to top party, yet in truth, it heavily surrounds itself from Said Iqbal and his top staffs. It is more democratic than most but still elite ruling for a labor party. For their own credits tho, they have an effective method in rallying the masses, protesting, having public debates and forums, even showcasing themselves as a committed activist base. This party is good for a political party standard, but don't expect to have a good progress in here considering they are good only as a rallying movement than a consistent political party.","","👍 (3)"
