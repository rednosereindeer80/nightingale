Most of them has at least +250 trader on it, and the best one has ±2000. People tend to believe that 'trading' could change their life, but little they know... 

They are trading, but what kind of supplies are they offering? Whats the market situation are they in? What are they investing on? They bet their life on some **random stick that goes up and down. Pathetic.**

As developer that also design the currency, built the website, and integrating it with wallet, all I can say is all the procedure there are **manipulated**. 

How does the stick goes up and down? How does it know the stock rises or drop? It's nothing than just an input, a simple setting that could determine either u win or lose by a single textbox. 

Those trading class think they are genius by inventing those candle trick, predicting the stockmmarket with those books and class full of craps. 

In fact, what they are doing is exactly what the owner wanted em to do, thinking like ""I won't fall to the same trick again"", ""This time it will rise just like before"", ""I knew this chart before"", and it's actually works fooling em all. 

We also read the latest book of trading techniques and used it on the real life action to fool em. When they think 'it can't be true', we rise it much so they would feel bad and start to believe on the tech book they saw. 

We even hired ytber to make 'hidden techniques' and book to predict our candle, now we got income from selling book, selling class, trading, AdSense, and more assets. 

I won't say that all trading are the same just like what my team develop, so it's up to u if u still want to continue on trading. 

Good luck.","","__ (1),☝️ (2)"

Yes, all of the trading project I participated in has these kind of admin panels to update the currency price.","",""

It's required to make chart looks 'realistic' and similar to what the trader learnt. 

When it comes to make the situation similar to the book, they take a look on those invest rate, if it high then they would make the trader loses, but if it low and they could handle the loss then they gonna make the trader win in order to build a trust on their platform and currency.","",""

At that moment, those YouTuber gonna put suggestion into those viewers head about a chart prediction. 

The viewers gonna keep their eyes on the website, waiting for the exact chart to come, while also joining the WhatsApp group about the currency. Little did they know, the owner of that trading platform also inside, watching the feedback of the traders, keeping their trust and attention. 

I can't say it's a scam bro. Those owner never said that the price is based on real stock or something, but the people naturally tend to believe that it is real. **It's just a currency that the owner could rises or lower the price whenever they want.**","",""

They are thinking that they are a bunch of opportunists who could outsmart the Admin and take a chunks of profit from it. They know they are fish lured by the fisherman's net, but they want to be those ""smart"" fish who beat the fisherman net. Their mentality is like Don Quixote against the Windmill.","","💀 (1)"
