By improving __burden sharing__, we can enhance resilience, and preserve the global security and trading systems for many decades into the future.

What forms can that burden sharing take?  There are many options, here are a few ideas:

1. First, other countries can __accept tariffs__ on their exports to the United States __without retaliation__, providing revenue to the U.S. Treasury to finance public goods provision.  Critically, retaliation will exacerbate rather than improve the distribution of burdens and make it even more difficult for us to finance global public goods.
2. Second, they can stop unfair and harmful trading practices by __opening their markets and buying more from America__;
3. Third, they can __boost defense spending and procurement from the U.S.__, buying more U.S.-made goods, and taking strain off our servicemembers and creating jobs here;
4. Fourth, they can invest in and __install factories in America__.  They won’t face tariffs if they make their stuff in this country;
5. Fifth, they could simply __write checks to Treasury__ that help us finance global public goods.
