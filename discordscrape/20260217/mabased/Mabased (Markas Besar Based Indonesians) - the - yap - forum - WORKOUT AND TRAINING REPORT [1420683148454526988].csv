Anyone else wants to report their workout? By all means, write it down here! I'd be nice to have as many cadres as possible reporting on their workout here

Today is pull day, but I still have a bit of a fever and GERD messing with me, so I vomited during my 3rd set of pull-ups. Nevertheless, I carried on, trying to reduce the symptoms by drinking water to neutralise the stomach acid somewhat, and it worked

Anyway, since this is my first day of the gym after more than 2 months (2 months and 13 days to be precise) and I have my half-sister's wedding to attend to tomorrow, I was only able to work out for 30 minutes, of which today's session is:

- Pull ups (10 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps, 4 reps, 3 reps)
- Cable rows 8 stacks so that's probably around 50 kg (10 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps, 4 reps)
- Supinated dumbbell curls 10 kg (10 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps, 5 reps)","","😭 (1)"

Woke up at 4.30 AM, cause I gotta check in to work by 6.30 AM. Time was limited, so I spent only 45 minutes in the gym, the rest was for prepping breakfast, showering, etc. But it didn’t feel enough, so I trained again once I got home from work

I got a friend from Gaza and he recommended me this routine:

“So you'll do
One warm up set (3-4 reps)

Rest 2 minutes

First set: 8-9 reps (leaving 1-2 reps in reserve)

Rest 3 minutes

Second set: complete failure

Rest 3 minutes

Final set: complete failure”","",""
