Originally, war wagons were seen during ancient China with the ancient Chinese formed a circle formation with their wagons or carts in order to counter Xiongnu cavalrymen's attack (Xiongnu are basically ancient Mongolian formed with confederation with other nomads). The Hussites however, perfected the war wagons under one leader named Jan Zizka. The wagon is modified with protective sides with firing slits (where crossbowmen and handgunners can use the holes to fire their projectiles). Meanwhile the wagons were supported by the heavy firepower from cannons, then by infantry, armed with pikes, spears, and various polearms. The main usage of these wagons happened during the Hussite Wars, where the largely peasant army of the Hussite armies used these innovative tactics to fend off against the heavy cavalrymen charge. In the official records:

""When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent, the Bohemians usually formedformed a square of the armed wagons, joined them with iron chains, and defended the resulting fortification against charges of the enemy. Such a camp was easy to establish and practically invulnerable to enemy cavalry."" - *Stephen Turnbull. Random House The Hussite Wars (1419–36). Osprey Publishing.*

The innovation of wagons are so effective, that the Germans, Danish, Hungarians, Polish-Lithuanian, Cossacks, and even the Russians created their own variations of the weapon. Throughout the 15th to 16th century, war wagons had been extensively, only to be defeated by cannons and well-trained musketeers.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1353002396791341128/1353002397106176070/1200px-josef_mathauser_-_bitva_u_lipan_roku_1434.png?ex=69966bed&is=69951a6d&hm=161b77408461bbbb5922db3e39c3e456eb13e63f619fc97a13dcfec19d9c91e3&",""

- Motor gerobak (modified)
- Hand pulled wagons or carts (modified)
- Horse wagons or carts (modified)

Tactics:
- Manned up the wagons, upgrade it with sturdy materials (metal is preferred)
- Allow the men on the wagons armed with projectiles, polearms, and long reach weapons)
- Chained the wagons together with iron chains while forming the square or circle formation
- Defend the wagons using any means necessary until reinforcements attack from the flanks

Advantages:
- It can resist riot personnel, even heavily armored ones
- It can resist water cannons (depending on its power along with the sturdy materials the wagons were built with, also need shields to protect from the cannons)
- Allowing protesters to fire projectiles back in safe cover
- Protective sides of the wagon allow projectiles from personnel to go null
- It can be a mobile fortifications since it can be moved everywhere
- It can resist motorcycles (depending on the speed)

Disadvantage:
- It can't resist armored cars, tanks or heavy apc (depending on how much you guys can stacked the wagons, it can also caused these vehicles to be stuck too)
- It can't resist gas weapons (because it is gas obviously)
- It only good enough to be in flat terrains or high ground ones which requires a lot of spaces
- Without reinforcements, it can make the fort into a trap for the defenders where they got surrounded by the riot personnel with no way out.
- Artillery can still do huge amount of damages","","💯 (1)"
