||The emperor in reverse, six of cups, nine of cups.

You might feel some control, whether it is your own doing or an external force control upon you, and this control isn't necessarily a good thing, it might feel heavy and almost claustrophobic. You might feel it's a famliar situation and that you have countered this kind of problem a lot. In order to feel more in-tune with yourself, you have to reflect back and remind yourself what has worked and what not, always protect yourself and your psyche, you are almost there. Don't forget to get proper rest 💚||","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1420693239400235018/1420736734991351868/SPOILER_IMG20250925153229.png?ex=69964df1&is=6994fc71&hm=088a563a839b92c264d06ee60a392205b30472dde4cc2ec46bbb42c93afb0bb3&",""

||Wheel of Fortune, The High Priestess, Death in Reverse

Heavy emphasis on cycle here. Remind yourself where you stand in your journey/plan right now, the table can turn pretty instantly, whatever you do, trust your intuition, and don't hold back change. You will be feeling catharthic (?) and have some relief with whatever you are worrying about right now, and again, do not hold back what is coming.||","",""

||The Fool, Three of Wands, and Six of Swords in reverse

There's a new chance for something new coming, and it might be a whole new untouched grounds or unknown area. It might be related to something beyond you, something for the community or something of a broader effect, it expands wide. It might be a long-term target to chase after too, thus you might feel some sense of uncertainty and resistance. You have to finish or get done with what's holding you back before you moving onto the next one, so if you take the chance, you can go smoothly.||","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1420693239400235018/1420737482743349289/SPOILER_IMG202509251537082.png?ex=69964ea3&is=6994fd23&hm=03fbca4976bc5c2b0696cc2711cfb7d6a904bda9ecd2a1f732e7bb5d6d9724ee&",""
