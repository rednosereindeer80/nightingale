Here's the thing about Indonesian election: 80% of Indonesian populace never really knew about their own candidates very well to begin with except for presidential candidate (From Line Today data). This is true for the people aged from 17 to 35 years old, which suggest the heavy gaps between the so called ""people's representative candidates"" with the societal communities in general. But before we jumped into it, there are a few things that someone must know before they signed themselves up as a caleg, calgub or calwalkot:
1. DPD, Walikota & Gubernur can be from independent candidates, while DPRD and DPR cannot as they must have their political party.
2. For age requirements: DPRD, DPD and DPR could have at least 21 years old, with Bupati or Walkot being 25 years old, and Gubernur being 30 years old. 
3. Mentally & physically healthy, can read, write, etc (obvious things that many can do)
4. Any PNS, Police, Military or other public servants had to resigned their positions if they wanted to sign up for the campaign.
5. Had to be done with jailtime if the person has criminal records (obviously none of us except for some old veteran politicians)","",""

You simply have to do surveys and introduce yourself to the communities in order to make them know you. During my experience helping a few kaders, this is what they do. Some of them are quite smart to hold multiple public conference to let all people meet them as caleg, receiving questions and answers. But this can only work further if people worked in the communities before. For example, if you join local organizations, commitees or other conferences years before you even go as caleg or other candidates, you might be able to be recognized even further by many figures. This is especially true to people from various social classes. The common problem with many caleg and other candidates is that they never really make their appearances through this method before. Second, taking surveys such as asking people or receiving datas from journals about the situation of the region shall be useful in order to get them. Sure, you can relied on your party to get them for you, but it will be better if it came from your own understanding than their understanding.","",""

Rather than using normal posters to be hanged into the public walls or poles, it is better to use social medias while paying promoters to promote you in order to gain more voices through younger generations. This is something that a few kaders forget even though they are young people themselves. Younger people tend to hear things from social media, while older people tend to hear then believe things when they saw it by themselves. So try to take a balanced approach in this one (but that is if you have the budgets). If you have your own designing skills for posters and such, that will be even better since you don't need to pay someone for that, but rather yourself to do so in the first place. Sometimes digital campaign is much easier yet cheaper, with the impact can be spread with greater access as long the populace in the region uses phones. If not, then try the conventional methods.

3. Populace Social Status & Demands
Sometimes the best way to convinced the populace is to see where they came from in  terms of background. Are there more people came from urban class or rural class? Are there more women or men? More elderly or younger people? More workers or businessmen? The list goes on and on. You need to convinced the majority first before going the minority, since that is what at least will assure you to win the local election. Then see the demands using the previous local survey method to gain the populace's heart through your proposals.","",""

With majority of populace, came not only in social status or class, but also in terms of regions. You will need to map the areas properly about each settlements and areas. Which areas got the most populace? Which areas got the most supporters from your party, or even opposition party? How do these positions will affect your campaign and what will happen if you don't take the chance to campaigning on these areas? So many thoughts to be carefully measured, with richer backed candidates can easily spend their money on these things, but if you came from humble background, chances are, you will need to strategize even further about whose settlements the populace you want to convince. Having your teams along with allocation of resources along with numbers can be crucial in promoting your campaign into the right people, and right areas, with the right timing (many young kader failed this from what I can observe compared to veteran politicians).","",""

Sometimes joining public events can be a good way to promote your candidacy and appearances. It can vary to many, from local football event, cultural event, religious event, etc etc and etc. You also need to introduce yourself to them while keeping your entire persona being humble yet intelligent enough to convinced some of the newer people that you are a suitable candidate. Yet you are also racing with time since other candidates will do the same, thus there are high chances they can be reached out first before you reached them, which make timing into a crucial thing that someone need to do while positioning themselves into the suitable events that will get their publicity higher.

6. Get Business Sponsors & Influencers
What do you know, these days you can not only relied on yourself to spread your fame and candidacy through your own party, but also through influencers that endorsed you or businesses that want you to get their businesses to be secured. Their deals can be vary, and their demands can be many, thus it is your job to choose them carefully while seeing their background too. Sometimes businesses can be a risky one as they like to operate in shady deals with other candidates, with higher chances your oppositions will took the chance to make deals with them first before you do. Again, it is a race, especially if there are a lot of caleg in one single region, though lesser numbers of them if you are going to run for mayorship or governorship (there may be more in 2029 due to 0% threshold).","",""

To be honest, before you even began your political campaign, you should have already settled on the objectives, goals and promises you want to make first to the people. You need your local surveys, your own knowledge and various feedbacks to get the proper way of promoting these goals and objectives of yours properly. This should have been more than obvious, yet some candidates tend to forget about this, describing their goals and promises being very vague, with little to no explanation, etc etc. Ensure your goals are good enough to get your wording to be properly worded while it can be delivered through every minds that hear or read your promises.

8. Getting Tribal Support, Various Ethnic Groups & Transmigrators
In certain areas with high ethnocentrism, along with tribalism and good amount of transmigration, there will be a need to get some local yet traditional figures on your side. Areas like Papua have high tribalism thus chieftains along with other tribal leaders are essential to be convinced. Meanwhile in certain cases, religious or cultural leaders within villages or settlements can be approached for their further convincing in cases if the populace are very centered within this type of leadership to begin with. Transmigrators also played a role within certain areas, depending in which regions you want to run yourself in, so always keep in mind with it. If a region also filled with ormas influence, chances are, you need to approach the ormas to support you too or at least be neutral to your campaign since other candidates can easily steal them from you. Being a native or even someone that is related to them can be very helpful in winning the campaign, since it gave the image that a native honest politician that knows about his surroundings is chosen to lead a region that he/she already know to begin with.","",""

They can bribe, doing money politics, make shady deals with business, smearing campaign, and the list of methods can go on and on. So ensure you have a solid planning to even begin your campaign before you even go to it in the first place. You can either lose big or win big with your political campaign.**","",""
