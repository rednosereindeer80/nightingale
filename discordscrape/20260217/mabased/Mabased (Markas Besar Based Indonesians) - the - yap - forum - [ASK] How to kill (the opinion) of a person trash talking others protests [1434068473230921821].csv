He’s a deeply nihilistic person who believes Indonesia will never become a great nation. He even once said, “If Indonesia ever becomes great, I’ll give all my riches to you all.” I honestly don’t know if I share his belief, but I certainly don’t share his hopelessness.

Yesterday at lunch, he started trash-talking the teachers’ protest, saying, “It’s their fault for choosing to be teachers.”
That really set me off — I almost went out of character.

I told him,

“It doesn’t matter if this country falls apart today or tomorrow, as long as something better eventually rises. But I sympathize with those most affected by the broken system — the teachers, the nurses, the doctors.
The nation needs them, but the system fails to protect their well-being.
When you’re sick, you still need a doctor. You’re sitting here today because teachers taught you.
My mother was a teacher — she was lucky enough to become a civil servant. But those who are protesting? Maybe they weren’t as lucky. So don’t you dare look down on them, Cock.”

He didn’t back down. Instead, he doubled down with,

“Still their fault for choosing their job. And if I ever get sick, I’ll just go to Malaysia or Singapore for treatment.”

At that point, I was furious — but I didn’t want to turn into the same kind of asshole he was being.
So I simply said, “Alright, do what you want.” and stopped there.

Now I’m left wondering: what could I have said to make him realize how wrong he was — not to humiliate him, but to make him trip over his own flawed logic in front of everyone?","",""

Mungkin Mas","",""
