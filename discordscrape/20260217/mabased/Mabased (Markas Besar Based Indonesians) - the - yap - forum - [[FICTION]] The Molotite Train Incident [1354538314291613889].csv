In the first part of 1952 (1952 1/4), the Vetokian Democracy held an election to determine the new ruling party on the government.

There were 5 right wing parties, known as the Pravonschina coalition. The Leftist coalition only had one political party, which was the council workerist party of the Molotite Party. In 1952 1/4, the devastated workers voted for the Molotite party. The Molotite party was just back from their escape in Espoutique, after escaping rom the fascist Vetokian regime. The Molotite Party was actually outside of Vetokia, or outside of defined Vetokia. They heard the news, and so, the leaders of the Molotite party went back to the Vetokian capital of Zamdozhe. In the midway, situated in modern Byrman Krasniyan Revolutionary Commune, in the city of Krepnipoy, or now known as Nong-Ga, the leader of the political party Ladny Krunikov, and other elites of the party was on a train, then due to the Vetokian Constitutional Assembly fearing of a radical leftist rule, they shot the train in Krepnipoy.

Only 2 politicians died, and so, the people protests against the assembly for attempting to kill their leaders. They were shot. It's unknown if the assembly ordered the firing of the workers, or either the military was playing in the background, since most of the leaders of the Pravonschina coalition are military leaders, but none were written in the Vetokian constitution that the military is able to be ordered to intervene at any protests. 

Only after 5 days, the workers have taken the rifles, and armed themselves to overthrow the assembly, organised by top military leaders who erved for Fascist Vetokia such as Sernei Virokhnoy, and Gazhd Veronoy.","",""
