cold war wise, I'm more curious about Sino-Russian dynamics/relations, maybe around ~1948 or the Korean War in the 1950s until the fall of the USSR in 1992 and the Yugoslav Wars (~1991 until ~2001), maybe the cold war from the Indo perspective

+ I'm curious of y'alls opinions on stuff like thesee soo feel free to share ofc","",""

Suffice to say, the Cold War started due to the insecurity from both sides, as it was obvious that after the WW2, Soviet Union managed to safeguard its territories and even controlled their captured ones to be communist regimes in the countries it had liberated from Nazi control. This alarmed the US and UK, which in return further sharpened by US Marshall Plan in 1947, basically financial aid to many European and other countries outside Europe in order to prevent any spread of communism to retain their containment of the communist ideology. In response, the Soviet Union established Comecon to counter the Marshall Plan by granting economic aid for its own communist regimes. Then the US and its allies formed NATO, which then countered with Warsaw Pact by Soviet Union, alas building the Western Bloc and Eastern Bloc. Sino-Russian relations started with the Chinese Civil War as obviously the US supported the Kuomintang Nationalist regime while the Soviet supported the CCP. Since the CCP won their civil war against Kuomintang in 1949, the two relations got deeper due to them both have Communist ideologies and dislike the US intervention. The two formed Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in 1950. Meanwhile the Korean War was considered to be a proof of the two's relationship in intervening to establish another communist regimes to safeguard the geopolitical state of the Communists, which then countered with the US intervention that at the end, caused two states to remain in Korea (A simplified explanation in this one from me). Over time, the divergences that arose between China and Soviet came from their different interpretations and practical applications of Marxism–Leninism, along with their different foreign policy approaches.","",""

>1945-1963: Continuous escalation between the West and the East. Stalinism became the mode of most Communist countries (until his death), which is why capitalist countries like America could accuse communism as totalitarianism. Heavy geopolitical gaming, West builds up alliance through NATO and Marshall Plan quick while the USSR made Cominform and Warsaw Pact. Probably the most violent Cold War phase cause both the West and the East came eating up countries like Korea and Iran, they weren't shy out of nuking each other cause the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction was not yet understood, and espionage was the frontline.
>1963-1979: Detente. US and USSR realized that they came close to destroying each other, so the policy for both countries was to co-exist with a lot of competition. Both invested heavily in science, sports, technology and proxy wars instead, example is the Space Race. Stalinism died down so totalitarian communism was kinda frowned upon. US realized that democracies tolerated left wing backsliding to socialism so Kissinger said fuck democracy, adopted realpolitik and overthrew many democratic countries, installing them with right wing dictatorships from Korea, Indonesia, Pakistan, Chile to Argentina that's pro America and pro-capitalism. Vietnam War was the major contention point between US and USSR and the rest fuck themselves. China became its own thing and became a ""third power"".
>1979-1986: Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and Reagan was elected President. American capitalism started bearing prosperity and fruits, so Reagan said fuck communism and made steps to dump Detente policy and politicking and started morally policing the world. Every anti-communist insurgents suddenly gains a surge of funding, Neoliberalism is beginning to show good promise and USSR is stagnating economically due to being strained from their command economy. World almost went to nuclear war a few times cause NATO made aggressive wargaming exercise.","","💯 (4),kitty (1)"
