warning : (thing might be some kind of vent but dw its actually not that deep) 

im on school holidays for 40 days! 
this happens because im transitioning to tahun ajaran baru, and before that, theres a MONTH long of holiday break. 

i am an ACTIVE student in my school, i know almost half of the students in my school, i joined organizations, extracurricular and all that extra activities, now when its all gone, i kinda feel empty rn. 

at this moment of no pressure, no demands and no direction, idk how to feel better about my self, i have a lot of friends at school, but that happens because we have a shared schedule. theres barely anyone who talks to me outside of school. 

can anyone suggest what i should do in this long holiday of mine rn?","",""
