I mean sure I do pray in the mosque most of the time (cuz I'm working from home) and go to kajian (mostly by force but still listen to it), 

for me getting deep into religion really needs a lot of free time and as a working man that still got worldly urges, I'd say myself not really religious but still trying to practice the teaching (although it's not perfect)","",""

I do like to consider myself as religious. 
Not in arrogance, but because I submit myself to Allah and His will.","",""

Being religious usually can radicalize someone towards judging other people on the matter of beliefs. I prefer the term being spiritual as you can be deeply connected to your God without having to become religious. Though keep in mind, this is only my perspective as a Christian, it may or may not applied to other religions","","💯 (4)"

Privately I was considering myself more religious than in public since even when i Miss prayer, Once I done it on my own, That will be at least for me a good prayer , not too rushed or anything. 

Publicly, Yeah no I wasn't a very religious person regarding things that doesn't make sense. Like the fact some religious platform just throw logic out of the way and instead turn to conspiracy which is a sin if it turns out to be fake. I hate religious event because somehow the speakers was always gonna be in Horeg mode blasting my ears and if I close it I might be suspected keberisikan ama ayat-ayat suci. And please stop Dramatizing something like ""Oh, I see the prophet!"" And crying , I dont mind but my god did I feel the schizophrenic energy of it. Not to mocking or anything , but stop idolizing. Please stop idolizing a cleric like he's a Saint, stop it I dont need to kiss your feet or something. 

Religion is a Private manner, no one had the Authority to called you ""Separuh setan"" Or whatever , or even judging that you will go to hell. If Religion only makes you becoming more stupid, I think the problem isn't in your prayer, But your brain.","",""
