Now to answer the question being put forward here, I am on the principle of finding the balance between what is ideal and what is the reality of current situation and also assess the possibilities that comes with either being an idealist and being a realist. Being an idealist means that whatever that comes up in your way be it something or someone that doesn't aligned with your values and beliefs then you probably will finds it hard to grasp and try to act on what to do about it since me personally knows all too well when your idealism that you hold on for the longest time are facing a dilemma with what I'm facing at the time.

So to answer this question really is a YES and NO result to me, because I don't truly believe that being a full-fledge idealist can bring you more good, but also being a full-fledge realist isn't benefit your mind and heart in the long run either. So maybe find a balance, try to hold on on values and principles that you still hold on to and try to accept the reality of things.","","🔥 (3)"

Implementing Nietzsche's three metamorphoses, an idealist, I think, could be considered as Lion who rejects existing values with ""No"". It could be a roar if majestic, else it will be a meow :smile: 

Anyway the Lion is not the end, an idealist should strive to be the Child who no longer ask if something is should or should not but rather realize his own value with curiosity, creativity and play.","",""
