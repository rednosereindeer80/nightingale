As a working student you won't have as big of a responsibility as a full time and you'll only mostly ""learn"" how the company works. With this working contract, you'll be able to work 20hrs/Week and earn around 12-15€/hr. 

Unfortunately Polsci doesn't really offer as many job offers as Econs. But you'll find offer everywhere before the beginning of every winter and summer semesters. So you'll just have to actively look for offers.","","pepeWow (1)"
