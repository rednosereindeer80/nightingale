I've mainly been using a persona playlist with some other video game music thrown in as our background music, works fine enough but we've been playing it for a year now and i want something new.

I've looked around the internet but just cant find the right music that fits with the vibe. The game plays similar to uno with 100+ new cards, it can get pretty intense and confusing at times but it has its chill moments as well.

do yall have recommendations? 
thanks in advance","",""
