i'm opening my first ever d&d campaign, and it's called ""When Tides Echo.""

ALSO FUN FACT THE WHOLE PLOT OF MY CAMPAIGN IS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY THE OTOME GAME LOVE AND DEEPSPACE AND MY FAV CHARACTER'S LORE LMAO

i'm too lazy to write the whole premise here, so let me copy paste the advertisement i put on my d&d community's server:

**When Tides Echo** 🌊🐚⭐
**Game system**: D&D 5,5e (2024) & Homebrew Materials
**Players Needed**: 4-5
**Type of Game**: Mid to Long-term Campaign 
**Allowed Materials**: Homebrew. If you have any ideas or custom mechanics for your characters, please do tell me, and I may create something for you. I allow heavy personalization.
**Starting Level**: 1-5; I will decide what your character's starting level is after the character concept is done.
**Ability Score Method**: Point Buy (78) 
**Disclaimer**: 
This campaign will rely HEAVILY on roleplay and realism. If you send me a half-assed (but decent) backstory, I won't hesitate to give your character a level 1, and from there, I expect you to crawl your way into level 2, 3, 4, and 5. If you're a wizard and I give you a level 1, then do something about learning magic, and I will reward you with an increased level if I see fit. (Personal milestone-based.) Take your characters very seriously, take this world, my world seriously. I want you to interact and have a dialogue with my world, be it as your character or as yourself. THIS IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. Tread carefully.

**Themes and Tones**:  racial conflict (politics), religion, faith, blasphemy, love. VERY serious and heavy.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1408094388743180440/1408094389112143969/Screenshot_2025-08-18_182951.png?ex=69967457&is=699522d7&hm=53523bf25c5e130cdc351cc39caf6667ae0d911be0bc67916dd04ba7ac986d8f&",""

The Ivory Monastery has issued for the search of the missing Sea God's Bride. There is only 10 days until the Festival of the Sea Bride, and she MUST return to the Ivory Tower immediately. The Monastery has promised eternal boons for those who are capable of retrieving her: everlasting wealth and power. And the Monastery always keeps their promises. Are you the Hero who will find and return the Sea God's Bride?

---

*In this world where the Truth is riddled by, and subjected to Lies, you are but a single blind soul wandering without aim in this universal concoction of faith, religion, humanity, and... something else otherworldly. *

*""In the perpetual meantime of a sheltered eternity, most are content to live, and not to dream. But in the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall, there are those who dream of dreaming. Some say a few are chosen and the rest are dregs, but for those of you wish to set foot in this world of mine, what belief must you resonate with?""*

**The Order of the Veil**
""Everything is for the greater good. For humanity. We must preserve what has to be preserved for the sake of the greater good - in the name of selflessness.""
*And those who walk in the path of the Veil strive for greatness and human excellence, even at the cost of sin and hypocrisy.*

**The Covenant of the Drowned**
""We must take back what belongs to us. Our God has left us in the name of His Faith. Then we shall live in non-existence, for His Excellency has denied His gaze upon us.""
*The tides surge, and as such, heavenly tempest rages in the veins of the abandoned followers. For those who have been failed by His Holiness, they shall take back their Home even at the cost of blasphemy.*","",""

Please send me the concept of your character, namely: the **initial name**, the **belief** you wish to embody, the **race** (choose ONLY between Human or Merfolk), and the **concept** of your character (alignment, archetype, character goal, etc). The character creation process will have to be foreseen by me to ensure absolute immersion in my world - we will have to discuss and make your character alive.

A bit of a spoiler here, but I'm so hella excited because the whole campaign's all about racial conflict (that sounds so wrong but hear me out).

Basically, let's just say that the humans have stolen something from the Lemurians (merfolk). the humans are thriving due to the stolen artefact, meanwhile the Lemurians were driven away from their home (the deep sea) because they got their artefact stolen","",""

Tone: Dark political fantasy, epic tragedy, world-shaking

Bloody Bard Years: As Gortash’s assassin, young Strangelove commits infamous atrocities, earning a reputation as a sociopathic prodigy of violence.

Strangelove’s Rise (1492–1501): A bard of whispers rises from the slums of Waterdeep, guided by ruthlessness and brilliance, becoming Emperor of the Anagram Empire.

The Empire Consolidates (1502–1508): Through bureaucracy, ideology, and magitech (arcanium energy), the Anagram Empire becomes Faerûn’s superpower.

The Fourth Anagramic War (1509–1513): A massive war over the Weave itself, fought between the Empire, Central Alliance, and the Arcane Union (Thay & Halruaa). Millions die; Silverymoon, Amn, Elturgard, and Cormyr are ravaged. Legendary battles like Vincent Vollachia vs. Ubel define the war.

Twilight of the Gods (1514–1517): Strangelove, now bound to Ioun’s fragment and evolving into Pandorym, wages war against the divine. Selûne, Tempus, and Loviatar fall. Amanautor rewrites portfolios, letting mortals ascend.

Mortal Empires (1518–1520): The Chosen Five (Reinhard, Gale, Varanna, Zafira, Cornelius) confront Strangelove in a final apocalyptic battle. They sacrifice themselves to ascend as New Gods, ending the Godslayer Prophecy.","",""
