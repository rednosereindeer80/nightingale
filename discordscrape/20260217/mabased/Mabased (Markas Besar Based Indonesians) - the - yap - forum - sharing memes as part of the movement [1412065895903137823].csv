serious take here: 
1. psychologically, memes and funny moments make this movement seem more approachable. just like wowo's gemoy gemoy dance, it's very palatable to the general public, therefore more likely to go viral and engage more people.
2. for the activists, funny moments also provide a much-needed break from all the doom and gloom. this movement is not sustainable if all we do is get angry, go to a protest, and ponder how much shit we're in. lighthearted moments are essential in keeping this movement alive.

so achTuAlLY!! sending memeable moments from the protests is just as essential as posting all the serious stuff.

note: i'm curious, has there been research about this? about what kind of framing & tone works for successful vs. unsuccessful movements?","",""

For example, every time there’s banjir in Jkt, you’ll find kids swimming. If I recall correctly, during Anies time, we all made fun of the terrible banjir situation with signs like “kolam renang gratis”","","😭 (1)"
