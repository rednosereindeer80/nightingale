I was in primary school, but I saw the stars splitting the skies in half, soaring through the skies like something out of a fairy tale. 

Years later, I’m working for the very government that caused the stars to fall.


The warheads were already in the Great Plains when our AA systems locked on, why so long? Lack of maintenance, low budget, everything you’d expect from a dying government.
Our cyberassault teams tried to redirect the warheads but the fuel was running out and their defences were tough to break. But there was still hope, the fuel was enough to crash the warhead into the middle of the gulf without detonating, their countermeasures were broken. The required scripts were being packaged, compressed, burnt, written, the process was slow but fast enough for us to save America. 
3 minutes to the first detonation, 5 to the last. 
An error in the code.
Decades upon decades of stacked patches and updates, software written to be compatible with century-old hardware, scripts written in a hundred different languages, botch after botch and fix after fix, a labyrinthe of dying code and already dead hardware.","",""
