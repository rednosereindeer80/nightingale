Duolingo is currently facing significant backlash due to its shift towards an ""AI-first"" approach, leading to a wave of subscription cancellations and account deletions by users. The controversy began when Duolingo's CEO, Luis von Ahn, announced the company's transition to an AI-first model. This strategy involves replacing human content creators with AI-generated content, aiming to expand language offerings rapidly. While this move allowed Duolingo to launch 148 new courses, it also led to the layoff of approximately 10% of its contract workers.

basically people are hating their EVERY social media move in TikTok because of this mass cancellation, so many users remove their login streak as a sign of protest, this is by far the biggest company cancellation of all time.","",""

I read my senior's report about that China app, they did research about how efficient Duolingo on teaching language, and its no match againts this new China app.

Its just about time till Duolingo closed.","",""
