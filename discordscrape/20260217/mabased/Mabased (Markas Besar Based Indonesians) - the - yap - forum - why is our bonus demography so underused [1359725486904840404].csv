There is a mismatch between our education and the job market. Vocational and higher education often don’t match the skills industries need in Indonesia. This is combined with the fact that many graduates lack critical thinking, digital skills, or practical experience. As a result, we are potentially being gifted with educated unemployment or underemployment in informal sectors. Then for job creations, most of these new jobs come from low-productivity sectors (agriculture, retail, informal services, etc). Meanwhile industrial and more advanced jobs are not following the same amount of job creations. The government further lacks strategic incentives to retain or attract talent, especially in research, R&D, or creative industries. This is just naming a few problems that the government didn't do to solve it.","","👍 (5)"

Although Indonesia has the assets and potential to develop further as a country because of our citizens as a whole, we have to admit that there is a massive brain drain. Why?

The supposed brightest of the bunch—the cream of the crop—for Indonesia would rather be working abroad. To be honest, it’s an obvious choice: the pay is better, infrastructure is better, welfare is better, and most importantly, they are acknowledged based on their merit.

And then we have the second problem, which is that a lot of individuals, especially youth, are unemployed—not to mention those who are still in the working age and remain unemployed.

Now we talk about wealth disparity as another reason.

The upper-middle class and higher economic families and individuals are able to access so much information and so many opportunities compared to those from middle- and lower-income backgrounds.

The middle-income individuals do not qualify to receive educational or economic assistance because they’re not considered poor.

The poor lack proper infrastructure that would support their growth with the substance or knowledge that they receive. It’s like giving a fishing boat to someone who has never fished and doesn’t even have a fishing pole.","",""
