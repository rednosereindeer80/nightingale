Many people consider even the act of breathing and existing in the country as a living hell. How could they not, the Indonesian Government has been implementing the illogical and contradictory regulations ever since the president took over. Even the smallest things such as public relations to the public and media are practically non-existent. It instead comes over more as a threat, if anything. The quality of life in the nation is too abhorrent to be called “decent.” Because of this, most Indonesians have been opening their minds and they are well aware of the political situation in their country—or so they say as being ‘melek politik’.","",""

Some, however, continue to stay—perhaps out of necessity, with no other means of getting out of the country. One thing is for certain: the people of Indonesia demand a change for the better of the country through demonstrations in any way, shape, or form. Life should exist without threat and fear of death hanging over its citizens. Injustices when committed by the government are held accountable. A place where people of the country are prioritized first over those in power.","",""

The structure of this piece is divided into two sections, one section for each page. The first section is written with short, fluctuating, and intensifying ideas and many pauses in between, a dream that slowly reveals to be a nightmare interrupted with empty voids in your mind. You try to recall your pleasant memories and heroic dreams, to reminisce the glory you once had. Your consciousness suddenly wakes you up with hauntingly loud gunshots (as well as the realization that you still only have one testicle, don’t kill me). The second part starts with a passage marked misterioso as a mini transition to start the finale. A familiar tune mangled by its own guilty conscience, accelerating until it erupts and falls back into the ground, where lies an homage to a land of death. Every measure in this work was planned with great detail until the end.","",""
